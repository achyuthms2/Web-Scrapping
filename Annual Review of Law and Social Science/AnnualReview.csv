0,Law and/or/as Civility, Keith J. Bybee,"The United States, like many countries around the world today, is experiencing the disruption of traditional patterns of governance and the breaking of norms of everyday behavior. If we identify the norms of governance with the rule of law, and if we consider the norms of everyday behavior to constitute civility, then we can approach the current state of affairs by asking how law and civility relate to one another. I survey and discuss three different understandings of the law/civility relationship: law and civility, law or civility, and law as civility. Each of these understandings is an analytical resource, and as such, each understanding captures a facet of a complex relationship and provides a way to think about our current age of unrest.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120920-084221,Oct-21,Vol. 17,1-14,
1,Social Theory and Legal Theory: Contemporary Interactions, Roger Cotterrell,"This article identifies points of comparison between legal theory and social theory and possibilities for research communication between them. The current range of both fields is such that each must be seen as a compendium of very diverse intellectual projects. So, the article explores particular contemporary themes around which the interests of juristic scholars and social theorists are converging, albeit that their theoretical aims often differ. Contrasting and complementary juristic and social theoretical perspectives are considered in relation to the following: the future of legal individualism, the identity of law as a social phenomenon, the relations of law and power, the contribution of law to societal integration, and the changing relation of law and the state. The article argues that these five themes reveal major intellectual challenges for both legal theory and social theory and productive future areas for inquiry.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102720-020551,Oct-21,Vol. 17,15-29 ,
2,Hobbling: The Effects of Proactive Policing and Mass Imprisonment on Children's Education, Benjamin Justice,"Researchers have written a good deal in the last two decades about the relationship between public education and criminal justice as a pipeline by which public school practices correlate with or cause increased lifetime risk for incarceration for Black and Latinx youth. This article flips the script of the school-to-prison pipeline metaphor by reversing the question. What are the effects of criminal justice on public schooling? Reviewing recent social science research from multiple disciplines on policing and incarceration, this article describes the relationship of criminal justice to public education as hobbling, a social process by which the massification of policing and incarceration systematically compromises the ability of target demographics of American children to enjoy their rights to a free and appropriate public education.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120920-084831,Oct-21,Vol. 17,31-51 ,
3,Governance by Data, Fleur Johns,"Law and social science scholars have long elucidated ways of governing built around state governance of populations and subjects. Yet many are now grappling with the growing prevalence of practices of governance that depart, to varying degrees, from received models. The profusion of digital data, and the deployment of machine learning in its analysis, are redirecting states’ and international organizations’ attention away from the governance of populations as such and toward the amassing, analysis, and mobilization of hybrid data repositories and real-time data flows for governance. Much of this work does not depend on state data sources or on conventional statistical models. The subjectivities nurtured by these techniques of governance are frequently not those of choosing individuals. Digital objects and mediators are increasingly prevalent at all scales. This article surveys how scholars are beginning to understand the nascent political technologies associated with this shift toward governance by data.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120920-085138,Oct-21,Vol. 17,53-71 ,
4,"Truth Commission Impact on Policy, Courts, and Society", Onur Bakiner,"This review surveys the philosophical underpinnings, conceptual frames, and methodological choices informing the scholarship on truth commission impact to examine whether, how, how much, and why truth commissions influence policy, court decisions, and social norms. It focuses on three areas: (a) truth commission impact as the product of complex interactions between politicians, civil society activists, and truth commissions; (b) conceptual and methodological debates and disagreements in studies of impact; and (c) normative visions guiding expectations and assessments. The findings of empirical scholarship range from partial confirmation of bold and at times vague expectations to damning accounts of commissions’ failure to deliver. In addition to conceptual and methodological choices, scholars’ normative assumptions and expectations also explain divergent accounts of truth commission impact. Three sets of normative frameworks set the expectations in particular: building liberal democratic institutions; transforming socioeconomic, gendered, and racialized hierarchies; and reflecting local values, norms, and power dynamics.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-111620-010000,Oct-21,Vol. 17,73-91 ,
5,Legal Responsibility Among the Young and the Elderly, Eve M. Brank and  Lindsey E. Wylie,"The decision of whether to hold someone legally responsible raises both philosophical and psychological questions. Philosophically, legal responsibility derives from either what someone did or who someone is—deed or role responsibility. For both the young and the very old, responsibility for bad actions is intertwined with psychological definitions of competency and capacity. For the young, the law assumes incompetence until a certain chronological age or court determination. For the old, no automatic chronological age is determinative; rather, the law assumes competence until a court determines otherwise. These automatic or court determinations impact legal responsibility in both the civil and criminal law contexts for both the young and the old. Additionally, special circumstances create responsibilities for others in relation to the young and old.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-021721-091626,Oct-21,Vol. 17,93-108 ,
6,Gender Inequalities in Markets, Tamar Kricheli-Katz,"Various forms of inequality, such as the gender, race, and class systems of inequality, operate and intersect in societies and markets. In this review, I discuss specifically the gender system of inequality. I focus on market interactions, conceptualizing them as the building blocks for gender inequalities in markets. My objective is to give an account of the complex interplay between the unequal distributions of resources, stereotypes and cultural beliefs about gender, and the law. I start by describing the persistence of gender inequality in markets. Building on studies in social psychology, I then identify the ways in which stereotypes and cultural beliefs about gender constantly, and unconsciously, frame our market interactions. Lastly, I discuss the limits of the law in altering the ways in which we interact in markets and the potential of the law to bring about lasting change.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-111620-012514,Oct-21,Vol. 17,109-122 ,
7,The Reasonable Person Standard: Psychological and Legal Perspectives, Mark D. Alicke and  Stephanie H. Weigel,"In criminal cases of self-defense and provocation, and civil cases of negligence, culpability is often decided with reference to how a reasonably prudent person (RPP) would have behaved in similar circumstances. The RPP is said to be an objective standard in that it eschews consideration of a defendant's unique background or characteristics. We discuss theory and evidence suggesting that in morally relevant judgments, including those involving negligence, self-defense, and provocation, the tendency to rely on the self—on one's own values and predilections—dominates considerations of the RPP. We consider subjective standards that have been proposed as alternatives to the RPP and review research on this topic. We conclude by considering avenues for future research, particularly addressing conditions in which self-standards of reasonableness are most likely to prevail.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-111620-020400,Oct-21,Vol. 17,123-138 ,
8,Business and Human Rights: Alternative Approaches to Transnational Regulation, Surya Deva,"In recent years, various approaches to transnational regulation of business conduct have evolved as an alternative to the command-and-control model focusing on conduct of domestic businesses and the soft law approach of international human rights law to regulate corporations. On reviewing the potential of five such approaches (i.e., polycentric governance, extraterritorial regulation, proposed international treaty, reform of corporate laws, and rebalancing of trade-investment agreements), this article makes two arguments. First, although polycentric governance is critical to fill regulatory deficits of state-based regulation, this approach should not ignore or weaken further the role and relevance of states in regulating businesses, given the dynamic relation between state-based and other regulatory approaches. Second, greater attention should be paid to nonhuman rights regulatory regimes to change the corporate culture, which tends to externalize human rights issues. The increasing focus on the role of corporate laws and trade-investment agreements should be seen in this context.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-113020-074527,Oct-21,Vol. 17,139-158 ,
9,"Protecting Basic Legal Freedoms: International Legal Complexes, Accountability Devices, and the Deviant Case of China"," Terence C. Halliday,  Shira Zilberstein, and  Wendy Espeland","With a focus on legal and other organizational actors beyond the state, this article seeks to expand the theory of conditions under which legal occupations will mobilize to fight for basic legal freedoms within states. It elaborates the line of scholarship on legal complexes and political liberalism within states since the 17th century. First, we catalog harms that international organizations (IOs) of many kinds seek to protect in the more than 190 states in the world. Second, we elaborate the concept of an international legal complex (ILC) as a collective actor in the global struggle for basic legal freedoms. We illustrate these two steps with new data on China drawn from a wider project. We show what harms mobilize the ILC, international human rights organizations (IHROs) and an international governmental organization, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). We focus on accountability devices as tools differentially deployed by the ILC, IOs, and UNHRC in theirefforts to influence the institutionalization of basic legal freedoms, an open civil society, and a moderate state in China. The illustrative case of China provides a framework for research and theory on all other countries.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-111620-013613,Oct-21,Vol. 17,159-180 ,
10,The Impact of Experienced and Expressed Emotion on Legal Factfinding, Jessica M. Salerno,"Judges and jurors are asked to comb through horrific evidence of accidents and crimes when choosing verdicts and punishment. These factfinders are likely to experience and express intense emotions as a result. A review of social, cognitive, moral, and legal psychological science illuminates how experienced and expressed emotions in legal settings can unconsciously bias even the most well-intentioned, diligent factfinder's decision-making processes in prejudicial ways. Experiencing negative emotions creates motivation to blame and punish—instigating blame validation processes to justify guilty/liability verdicts and harsher punishments. The review also examines how emotion expression can impugn legal actors’ credibility when it violates factfinders’ (often unrealistic) expectations for appropriate emotion in legal contexts. It considers misguided and promising interventions to help factfinders regulate emotional responses, advocating limiting emotional evidence as much as possible and, when not possible, helping factfinders reframe how they think about it and remain aware of their potential biases.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-021721-072326,Oct-21,Vol. 17,181-203 ,
11,Street-Level Meta-Strategies: Evidence on Restorative Justice and Responsive Regulation, John Braithwaite,"Restorative justice may be effective because it is a street-level meta-strategy that is responsive and relational. Nonresponsive, nonrelational strategies that are enacted from desks are less likely to be effective; best-practice strategies may be less likely to be effective than wisely sequenced meta-strategies. Responsive regulation is conceived as a strategy of moving among strategies, as opposed to selection of any best strategy. Restorative justice is a way of selecting strategies to heal the hurts of injustice. Empathic empowerment of stakeholders who take turns to speak in a circle is at the heart of its strategy for strategy selection. Restorative justice can complement responsive regulation; at their best, they are mutually constitutive. Responsive regulation may work best when restorative justice is a first preference at the base of a pyramid of strategies. Responsive regulation involves listening and flexible deliberative choice among strategies arrayed in a pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid are more frequently used, noncoercive strategies of first choice. Despite encouraging evidence that restorative and responsive regulation can work better than less dynamic top-down enforcement, the effectiveness of restorative justice and responsive regulation depends mainly on the efficacy of the interventions that are responsively chosen. It is time to redirect research and development to improving the quality of restorative-responsive strategy selection and the quality of the diverse strategies on offer.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-111720-013149,Oct-21,Vol. 17,205-225 ,
12,Transitional Justice and Property: Inextricably Linked, Helena Alviar García,"This article analyzes the different ways in which transitional justice has dealt with demands over property restitution and redistribution. To do this, it presents a review of academic literature regarding how to define reparation, the justifications for restitution, and the debate regarding property redistribution as a part of peace negotiations. The article ends with a synthesis of the different critiques raised to the ways in which restitution and redistribution of property have been legally structured. These critiques include foregrounding neoliberalism (as an economic ideal and a governance project) in transitional justice, unveiling gender biases as well as demands for more comprehensive redistribution in the aftermath of civil war.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120920-085908,Oct-21,Vol. 17,227-238 ,
13,Replicability in Empirical Legal Research, Jason M. Chin and  Kathryn Zeiler,"As part of a broader methodological reform movement, scientists are increasingly interested in improving the replicability of their research. Replicability allows others to perform replications to explore potential errors and statistical issues that might call the original results into question. Little attention, however, has been paid to the state of replicability in the field of empirical legal research (ELR). Quality is especially important in this field because empirical legal researchers produce work that is regularly relied upon by courts and other legal bodies. In this review, we summarize the current state of ELR relative to the broader movement toward replicability in the social sciences. As part of that aim, we summarize recent collective replication efforts in ELR and transparency and replicability guidelines adopted by journals that publish ELR. Based on this review, ELR seems to be lagging other fields in implementing reforms. We conclude with suggestions for reforms that might encourage improved replicability.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-121620-085055,Oct-21,Vol. 17,239-260 ,
14,Water Security and International Law," Philippe Cullet,  Lovleen Bhullar, and  Sujith Koonan","International law seeks to ensure water security and to prevent or resolve conflicts leading to water insecurity. This relationship is based on a hybrid framework comprising binding and nonbinding instruments. The multi-scalar dimensions of water (in)security are recognized, but further engagement is required. The link between international law and water (in)security is considered primarily through the lens of international water law, which focuses on transboundary (surface) watercourses. Groundwater—the other main source of water and determinant of water (in)security—receives little attention. Further, the traditional state-centric approach, with its emphasis on sovereignty and cooperation, remains the dominant paradigm despite some attempts to redefine it. Several other branches of international law present opportunities for expanding international law's engagement with the water security discourse. Finally, the climate change challenge requires a reconsideration of international law's approach to water (in)security while considering the global dimensions of water.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-010421-014915,Oct-21,Vol. 17,261-276 ,
15,"What Is Cultural Cognition, and Why Does It Matter?", Jeffrey J. Rachlinski,"By all accounts, we currently live in a polarized political state in which virtually every fact is contestable. From climate change to vaccine efficacy, people feel free to choose their own facts to support politically charged arguments. Partisans in every area of American life are unable to agree on the basic assumptions underlying political debate. Research on cultural cognition demonstrates that people's political and cultural commitments shape how they process information from news sources, scientists, and public officials, thereby dictating which policies they support and which ones they oppose. When partisan loyalties determine what evidence people will accept, political compromise becomes difficult or even impossible. All is not lost, however. Cultural cognition has a powerful influence, but facts are stubborn things. In some areas of public debate, facts and evidence have overcome political divides. Furthermore, an understanding of the influence of cultural cognition can facilitate remedies to partisanship. This article examines the research that demonstrates the extent of cultural influences on people's understanding of public debates, identifies the limits of cultural cognition, and describes the extent to which cultural cognition itself provides keys to breaking down partisan divides.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-011921-060754,Oct-21,Vol. 17,277-291 ,
16,Contract Schemas, Roseanna Sommers,"This review draws on the notion of “contract schemas” to characterize what ordinary people think is happening when they enter into contractual arrangements. It proposes that contracts are schematically represented as written documents filled with impenetrable text containing hidden strings, which are routinely signed without comprehension. This cognitive template, activated whenever people encounter objects with these characteristic features, confers certain default assumptions, associations, and expectancies. A review of the literature suggests that contract schemas supply (a) the assumption that terms will be enforced as written, (b) the feeling that one is obligated to perform, and (c) the sense that one has forfeited rights. Contract schemas should be of interest to legal scholars, because their psychological and behavioral effects often sit at odds with contract doctrine. Laypeople expect the law to find consent in situations where they would prefer it did not, and where it in fact does not. Contract schemas should also be of interest to ordinary consumers, who may find themselves relinquishing legally valid claims, erroneously assuming away rights, and/or blaming themselves. Future research should explore the consequences that flow from the lay perception that the law is rigidly formalistic to the detriment of fairness. Do such attitudes undermine the perceived moral authority of the law?",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-040721-103558,Oct-21,Vol. 17,293-308 ,
17,Algorithms and Decision-Making in the Public Sector," Karen Levy,  Kyla E. Chasalow, and  Sarah Riley","This article surveys the use of algorithmic systems to support decision-making in the public sector. Governments adopt, procure, and use algorithmic systems to support their functions within several contexts—including criminal justice, education, and benefits provision—with important consequences for accountability, privacy, social inequity, and public participation in decision-making. We explore the social implications of municipal algorithmic systems across a variety of stages, including problem formulation, technology acquisition, deployment, and evaluation. We highlight several open questions that require further empirical research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-041221-023808,Oct-21,Vol. 17,309-334 ,
18,Parole Board Decision Making and Constitutional Rights, Amelia Courtney Hritz,"Parole board decision making has changed dramatically over the last century, mirroring broader trends in criminal punishment. Even though parole decisions affect the length of prison sentences and the US Supreme Court has safeguarded defendants’ rights during the sentencing phase of criminal proceedings, the court has largely declined to interfere in parole. After briefly surveying the historical evolution of parole in the United States, this article proceeds in two parts. First, the article analyzes Supreme Court cases involving sentencing and parole and discusses questions raised by those decisions. Second, the article examines modern studies of parole board decisions and highlights ethical and legal questions raised by the research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-051121-070621,Oct-21,Vol. 17,335-351 ,
19,Infrastructures and Laws: Publics and Publicness, Benedict Kingsbury and  Nahuel Maisley,"Infrastructures are technical-social assemblages infused in politics and power relations. They spur public action, prompting increased scholarly reference to the practices of infrastructural publics. This article explores the normative and conceptual meanings of infrastructures, publics, and infrastructural publics. It distills from political theory traditions of Hannah Arendt, Jürgen Habermas, and Nancy Fraser a normative ideal of publics composed of the persons subject to a particular configuration of power relations that may significantly affect their autonomy. Autonomy can be seriously affected not only by existing or planned infrastructures, with their existing or anticipating users and workers and objectors, but also by the lack of an infra-structure or by the terms of infrastructural exclusions, rationings, channelings, and fiscal impositions. Legal-institutional mechanisms provide some of the means for infrastructural publics to act and be heard, and for conflicts between or within different publics to be addressed, operationalizing legal ideas of publicness. These mechanisms are often underprovided or misaligned with infrastructure. One reason is the murkiness and insecurity of relations of infrastructural publics to legal publics constituted or framed as such by institutions and instruments of law and governance. We argue that thoughtful integration of infrastructural and legal scaling and design, accompanied by a normative aspiration to publicness, may have beneficial effects.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-011521-082856,Oct-21,Vol. 17,353-373 ,
20,Advancing Socioeconomic Rights Through Interdisciplinary Factfinding: Opportunities and Challenges," Sarah Knuckey,  Joshua D. Fisher,  Amanda M. Klasing,  Tess Russo, and  Margaret L. Satterthwaite","The human rights movement is increasingly using interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, mixed-methods, and quantitative factfinding. There has been too little analysis of these shifts. This article examines some of the opportunities and challenges of these methods, focusing on the investigation of socio-economic human rights. By potentially expanding the amount and types of evidence available, factfinding's accuracy and persuasiveness can be strengthened, bolstering rights claims. However, such methods can also present significant challenges and may pose risks in individual cases and to the human rights movement generally. Interdisciplinary methods can be costly in human, financial, and technical resources; are sometimes challengingto implement; may divert limited resources from other work; can reify inequalities; may produce “expertise” that disempowers rightsholders; and could raise investigation standards to an infeasible or counterproductive level. This article includes lessons learned and questions to guide researchers and human rights advocates considering mixed-methods human rights factfinding.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-121620-081730,Oct-21,Vol. 17,375-389 ,
21,Philanthrocapitalism and the Separation of Powers, Linsey McGoey,"This article discusses the rise of an approach to philanthropic giving known as philanthrocapitalism. I relate it to a new paradigm in management theory that has claimed that private profit making naturally aligns with improved public welfare. I show how growing belief in the inherent “compatibility” of corporate missions and public benefits has led to new laws and contributed to major shifts in how giving practices are structured and legitimated. The original point made in this article is that the philanthrocapitalist turn is more than simply an organizational change in the structure of different philanthropic institutions. Rather, the belief that profit-making and public welfare are naturally aligned also has significant, undertheorized implications for different principles in European-American legal traditions. The ascendancy of the philanthrocapitalist approach represents a subtle but profound displacement of belief in the need for democratic checks and balances on the use of public funds for private enrichment.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120220-074323,Oct-21,Vol. 17,391-409 ,
22,"Constitutional Dictatorships, from Colonialism to COVID-19", Jens Meierhenrich,"In this article, I use the concept of constitutional dictatorship as a heuristic, as a way of thinking more explicitly about constitutional violence than is customary in comparative constitutional law. Constitutional dictatorship is an epic concept. It is capable of illuminating—and retelling—epic histories of constitutional law, of alerting us to commonalities in constitutional practices of domination—and thus of violence—that would otherwise remain shrouded in legal orientalism. The analysis aspires to make constitutional law strange again. To this end, I trace nomoi and narratives of constitutional dictatorship from colonialism to the coronavirus pandemic. Arguing against emergency scripts, I relate the idea of “emergency” to the everyday and both to coloniality. Mine is a rudimentary conceptual history—a Begriffsgeschichte—of constitutional dictatorship. I think of the empirical vignettes about crisis government in the colony/postcolony on which my comparative historical analysis is based as prolegomena to a critical theory of constitutional dictatorship.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-040721-102430,Oct-21,Vol. 17,411-439 ,

What are earlier Black-led movements centered on ending state-sanctioned violence? This article situates Black Lives Matter in a much longer lens and examines the long struggle to protect Black lives from state-sanctioned violence. We draw from existing research to provide a historical genealogy of the movement that traces the beginnings of a movement to protect Black lives to the work of Ida B.

24,Women's Rights After War: On Gender Interventions and Enduring Hierarchies, Marie E. Berry and  Milli Lake,"Postwar recovery efforts foreground gender equality as a key component of building more liberal democracies. This review explores the burgeoning scholarship on women's rights after war, first grappling with war as a period of possibility for building new gender-inclusive institutions. We review efforts in three arenas: increasing women's political representation in postwar democratic transitions; improving access to justice for women through the extension of property rights and bodily autonomy within systems of carceral justice; and integrating women into labor markets and security sectors through various components of the Women, Peace, and Security agenda. Yet these inclusionary efforts have too often sought to dismantle one form of oppression (gender inequality) without challenging others. We document how projects to center women in liberal democratic reforms following war inadvertently overlook other manifestations of violence at the core of these institutions.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-113020-085456,Oct-21,Vol. 17,459-481 ,
25,On the Interdependence of Liberal and Illiberal/Authoritarian Legal Forms in Racial Capitalist Regimes…The Case of the United States, Michael McCann and  Filiz Kahraman,"Scholars conventionally distinguish between liberal and illiberal, or authoritarian, legal orders. Such distinctions are useful but often simplistic and misleading, as many regimes are governed by plural, dual, or hybrid legal institutions, principles, and practices. This is no less true for the United States, which often is misidentified as the paradigmatic liberal constitutional order. Historical and critical scholarship, including recent studies of law under racial capitalism, provide reason to identify American law as a dual state in which legal forms that govern property ownership, contract relations, and civil liberties of free citizens differ from the more illiberal, authoritarian legal forms that rule over subaltern populations, particularly racialized, low-wage workers, Indigenous populations, the poor, immigrants, and women. This dual state, we argue, did undergo changes to adopt more procedurally liberal, professional, overtly deracialized legal forms after World War II, but these changes masked more than tamed the continuing illiberal, authoritarian violence that targeted marginalized citizens. While constantly changing, the American legal system is best understood not as a singular liberal order but instead as a hybrid system of mutually constitutive liberal and illiberal and authoritarian legal practices.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-111720-012237,Oct-21,Vol. 17,483-503 ,
26,"What the Study of Legal Cynicism and Crime Can Tell Us About Reliability, Validity, and Versatility in Law and Social Science Research"," John Hagan,  Bill McCarthy, and  Daniel Herda","We call for a further appreciation of the versatility of concepts and methods that increase the breadth and diversity of work on law and social science. We make our point with a review of legal cynicism. Legal cynicism's value, like other important concepts, lies in its versatility as well as its capacity for replication. Several classic works introduced legal cynicism, but Sampson & Bartusch named it. Kirk & Papachristos used a cultural framework to broaden it and added essential measures of perceived unresponsiveness and incapacity of police to ensure neighborhood safety and security. A structural theory of legal cynicism explains minority residents’ skepticism of, and desperate reliance on, police in the absence of alternative sources of safety. Historical and ethnographic studies play especially important roles in broadening the versatility of legal cynicism for the study of crime and responses to it.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-031620-093358,Oct-20,Vol. 16,1-20,

Building on a recent review in WIRES Climate Change, this article evaluates the growth of this literature and the key themes it highlights. In 2019, climate litigation literature experienced substantial growth, with a focus on multiple novel dimensions: new high-profile judgments; emerging legal avenues, types of actors, litigation objectives, and jurisdictions, especially those in the Global South; and additional interdisciplinary analyses. Just as in the underlying case law, climate litigation scholarship shows evidence of distinct but overlapping waves that build together in a manner similar to a harmonic chord. Even so, this literature has not yet engaged deeply with questions about the effectiveness of climate litigation as a governance tool, particularly in the context of the decentralized system formalized with the 2015 Paris Agreement.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-022420-122936,Oct-20,Vol. 16,21-38 ,

Our constitutional institutions and constitutional imagination, however, have not even begun to catch up with the new reality. In this article, I address four dimensions of the great constitutional silence concerning the metropolis: (a) the tremendous interest in cities throughout much of the social sciences, as contrasted with the meager attention to the subject in constitutional theory and practice; (b) the right to the city in theory and practice; (c) a brief account of what national constitutions actually say about cities, and more significantly what they do not; and (d) the dominant statist stance embedded in national constitutional orders, in particular as it addresses the sovereignty and spatial governance of the polity, as a main explanatory factor for the lack of vibrant constitutional discourse concerning urbanization in general and the metropolis in particular.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-051920-020619,Oct-20,Vol. 16,59-77 ,
30,Constructing the Human Right to a Healthy Environment, John H. Knox,"Despite the absence of a right to a healthy environment in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or any global human rights treaty, environmental human rights law has rapidly developed over the past 25 years along three paths: (a) the widespread adoption of environmental rights in regional treaties and national constitutions; (b) the greening of other human rights, such as the rights to life and health, through their application to environmental issues; and (c) the inclusion in multilateral environmental instruments of rights of access to information, public participation, and access to justice. After describing these developments, this review assesses the possible effects of UN recognition of the human right to a healthy environment, both on the environment and on human rights law itself.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-031720-074856,Oct-20,Vol. 16,79-95 ,
31,Conversations in Law and Society: Oral Histories of the Emergence and Transformation of the Movement," Calvin Morrill,  Lauren B. Edelman,  Yan Fang, and  Rosann Greenspan","This article uses oral histories of surviving founders to explore the emergence of law and society as a scholarly movement and its transformation to a scholarly field. The oral histories we draw on come from a unique public archive of interviews with founders of law and society titled Conversations in Law and Society, which is maintained by the Center for the Study of Law & Society (CSLS) at the University of California, Berkeley. We supplement and triangulate the CSLS oral histories with published sources that recount the history of law and society research. Our discussion begins with a brief review of the oral history approach and how the CSLS archive was constructed. We draw on the social movements literature to trace the emergence of the law and society field as a scholarly movement, showing how the movement drew strength from the political opportunities of the 1960s and 1970s; the mobilizing structures through which scholars created space for research and training; and the framing processes that crystallized the meanings, identities, and sentiments of the movement. We then present the founders’ perspectives on the characteristics of law and society as it became a scholarly field.While never becoming institutionalized as a discipline in the academy, law and society nonetheless spawned other scholarly movements and continues to influence research and teaching in social science disciplines and in law schools.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042824,Oct-20,Vol. 16,97-116 ,
32,Criminal Trials and Reforms Intended to Reduce the Impact of Race: A Review, Barbara O'Brien and  Catherine M. Grosso,"This review collects initiatives and legal decisions designed to mitigate discrimination in pretrial decision making, jury selection, jury unanimity, and jury deliberations. It also reviews initiatives to interrupt implicit racial biases. Among these, Washington's new rule for jury selection stands alone in treating racism as the product of both individual actors’ decisions and long-standing legal structures. Washington's rule shows the limits of recent US Supreme Court decisions addressing discrimination in cases with unusual and clearly problematic facts. The court presents these cases as rare remediable aberrations, ignoring the well-documented history of racism in jury selection. The final section juxtaposes limited reforms with the contemporary prison abolitionist movement to illuminate boundaries of incremental reforms. Reforms must reflect cognizance of the extent to which racism exists at multiple levels. Reforms that do not are less likely to make change, because they are either narrow in scope or focused on discrimination by individuals.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-042020-111040,Oct-20,Vol. 16,117-130 ,
33,Ethnographies of Global Policing, Jonny Steinberg,"The last two decades have seen an unprecedented proliferation of ethnographies of policing in many parts of the world. Implicit in the body of this new work is the continuation of an old and perhaps irresolvable debate on what policing is: the extralegal subjugation of subordinate populations or an agency whose authority is highly restricted by the norms of civilian populations. I argue that the best way to tackle this debate is to further develop the incipient practices of global ethnography, that is, to understand local practices via their global histories.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-030320-121837,Oct-20,Vol. 16,131-145 ,
34,Forensic Accounting, Colleen Honigsberg,"Forensic accounting serves as a regulatory and investment tool that allows interested professionals to predict whether firms are engaged in financial reporting misconduct. Financial reporting misconduct has severe economic and personal consequences. Not only does such misconduct distort the allocation of economic resources, but investors and employees of these firms incur substantial financial and psychological harms. In essence, forensic accounting aims to mitigate these harms by predicting the likelihood a firm has committed financial reporting misconduct—thus allowing for early detection of such misconduct. In this review, I provide an overview of the most popular forensic accounting techniques in the literature and the effectiveness of such techniques. Although traditional forensic models tended to focus on behavioral characteristics of the executives who commit financial misconduct or to take a purely numerical approach based on financial data, more recent models combine big data analysis with psychological intuitions.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-020320-022159,Oct-20,Vol. 16,147-164 ,
35,Governing the Belongings of the Precariously Housed: A Critical Legal Geography," Nicholas Blomley,  Alexandra Flynn, and  Marie-Eve Sylvestre","Precariously housed people face serious challenges in securing their personal possessions from the actions of both private and public actors. This is despite evidence of widespread destruction, seizure, and theft; associated violations of equality and dignity rights; the significance of the belongings to their owners; and the heightened vulnerability that the loss of their belongings may place people in. Law seems to provide minimal recognition and protection of precariously housed people's possessions. There is a significant lack of scholarly and policy attention given to the issue. We lay out some preliminary concepts for the analysis of this important topic, focusing on critical legal geography, evaluation, governance, and personhood, before introducing our own research project.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-021020-105357,Oct-20,Vol. 16,165-181 ,
36,Gun Studies and the Politics of Evidence, Jennifer Carlson,"This review is about scholarly contributions to a hotly debated issue—gun policy. Teasing apart the politics of evidence within gun politics, it examines both how research agendas shape gun policy and politics as well as how gun policy and politics shape research agendas. To do so, the article maps out two waves of gun research, Gun Studies 1.0 and Gun Studies 2.0. Gun Studies 1.0 emphasizes scientific evidence as a foundation for generating consensus about public policy, and it includes criminological studies aimed at addressing guns as criminogenic tools, public health work aimed at addressing guns as public health problems, and jurisprudential scholarship aimed at adjudicating guns as legal objects. Reviewing how these approaches incited popular debates and public policies that, in turn, shaped subsequent conditions of gun scholarship, the article then turns to Gun Studies 2.0. Instead of taking evidence as self-evident, this body of scholarship tends to prioritize the meaning-making processes that make meaningful—or not—evidence surrounding gun policy. Accordingly, Gun Studies 2.0 unravels the political and cultural conditions of the contemporary US gun debate and broadens inquiries into gun harm and gun security. In addition to discussing areas for future study, this study concludes by encouraging gun researchers to attend to the politics of evidence as they mobilize scholarship not just to inform the gun debate but also to transform it.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-020620-111332,Oct-20,Vol. 16,183-202 ,

Casey,  Kim Taylor-Thompson,  Estée Rubien-Thomas,  Maria Robbins, and  Arielle Baskin-Sommers","Healthy development is a fundamental right of the individual, regardless of race, ethnicity, or social class. Youth require special protections of their rights, in part owing to vulnerabilities related to psychological and brain immaturity. These rights include not only protection against harm but opportunities for building the cognitive, emotional, and social skills necessary for becoming a contributing member of society. They apply to all youth, including those within the adult criminal justice system, which raises the legal question of when adult capacity and responsibility begin and special protections are no longer warranted. This article highlights (a) empirical findings from developmental science on when psychological and neurobiological development reaches maturity; (b) the extent to which this scientific knowledge guides current policies and practices in the treatment of youth in the United States; and (c) emerging policies in the treatment of young people in the justice system based on developmental science.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-031101,Oct-20,Vol. 16,203-222 ,
38,Human Rights and Technology: New Challenges for Justice and Accountability, Molly K. Land and  Jay D. Aronson,"This review surveys contemporary challenges in the field of technology and human rights. The increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in decision making in the public and private sectors—e.g., in criminal justice, employment, public service, and financial contexts—poses significant threats to human rights. AI obscures and attenuates responsibility for harms in ways that undermine traditional mechanisms for holding wrongdoers accountable. Further, technologies that scholars and practitioners once thought would democratize human rights fact finding have been weaponized by state and non-state actors. They are now used to surveil and track citizens and spread disinformation that undermines public trust in knowledge. Addressing these challenges requires efforts to ensure that the development and implementation of new technologies respects and promotes human rights. Traditional distinctions between public and private must be updated to remain relevant in the face of deeply enmeshed state and corporate action in connection with technological innovation.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-060220-081955,Oct-20,Vol. 16,223-240 ,
39,Injury and Injustice, Anne Bloom,"This review examines the state of scholarship on the politics of injury law, a relatively neglected field. I argue that injury law is an important site of political contestation, particularly for social and economic minorities, that should receive much more attention from law and social science scholars. Drawing on past research from other areas of legal inquiry, especially rights litigation, I suggest that the political significance of injury law tracks along two key dimensions—the institutional and the symbolic—and that both dimensions deserve greater study. I also argue for collaborative research with legal practitioners, who have significant experiential knowledge to offer about how power operates in this space. The need for this research has perhaps never been greater, as corporate and other interests increasingly move to neutralize this historically important site of political contestation.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-043000,Oct-20,Vol. 16,241-256 ,
40,Law and Religion: Reimagining the Entanglement of Two Universals, Mona Oraby and  Winnifred Fallers Sullivan,"In the last few decades, the study of law and religion has undergone considerable reconstruction. Less and less constrained by modern statist construals of rights talk or tied to confessional contexts, the comparative study of the intersection of law and religion by anthropologists, historians, sociologists, and religious studies scholars is undergoing a real renaissance. Exciting new work explores the entanglement of legal and religious ideas, institutions, and material objects across the entire space and time of human history. This article models an engagement between the academic study of religion and sociolegal scholarship by introducing scholars in both fields to contemporary debates in the study of law and religion. These debates examine how and when state law persists as a meaningful arena of contestation; the role of indigenous elites and arrangements of legal pluralism in colonial contexts; and new approaches to economy, race, and sovereignty and citizenship. By mobilizing an understanding of law that does not take for granted the state's alleged monopoly on generating and regulating legal normativity, the article argues that holding law and religion in abeyance as normative traditions invites a far more expansive imaging of these universals in their singularity, in their copresence, and as overlapping domains.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-020520-022638,Oct-20,Vol. 16,257-276 ,
41,Online Dispute Resolution and the Future of Justice, Colin Rule,"Technology is changing the way we interact with each other, which in turn is changing the way we resolve our disputes. Every society throughout history has crafted social institutions to resolve problems fairly and consistently, and that is true also for the online society we are building on the Internet. Online dispute resolution (ODR) is the study of how to effectively use technology to help parties resolve their disputes. Originally crafted by companies like eBay to promote trust in eCommerce, ODR is now being integrated into the courts to expand access to justice and reduce costs. With the expansion of artificial intelligence and machine learning, ODR has the potential to become the new default for fast and fair resolutions, but there are many questions that still need to be answered, and much potential for fraud and abuse. In this article, I explain the need for ODR, provide a short history of its evolution, outline a rubric for building ODR systems, share some case studies demonstrating its use, and describe some ethical dilemmas that could accompany its expansion.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-043049,Oct-20,Vol. 16,277-292 ,
42,Personalism and the Trajectories of Populist Constitutions, David Landau,"This article reassesses the relationship between populism, democracy, and constitutionalism in light of the strong tendency toward personalism that populism often carries. Populists who have taken power in recent years have often sought to carry out formal or informal constitutional changes. Whereas some of these changes have been celebrated as constitutional innovations, many have been viewed as threats to democracy. Focusing on examples from Latin America, this article shows that despite the stress populists put on constitutional change, the phenomenon remains tied to the charisma of individual leaders. Populist leaders go to great lengths to remain in office, and succession poses an acute regime crisis. A core task for constitutional design is incentivizing populist leaders to leave power, which is more likely to be achieved by channeling politics than by judicial fiat. If this can be accomplished, the ultimate legacy of populist constitutions may be more beneficial, and less harmful, than commonly thought.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-041420-113519,Oct-20,Vol. 16,293-309 ,

We then provide detail on the institutional features and regulation—to the extent that there is any—of new products emerging to fill demand that remains when payday loans are more strictly regulated. Little is known about the effects of these new loan products on borrowers. What is certain is that state restrictions have led lenders to modify their loans to narrowly evade restrictions on interest rates, loan lengths, loan sizes, and repayment procedures like allowing loans to roll over. We focus on the starkest changes to small-dollar credit regulation that have occurred recently, including the development of high-interest installment loans, so-called flex loans offered by payday lenders, and the fintech creation of earned wage advance products.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-051820-014626,Oct-20,Vol. 16,311-326 ,
44,Responsive Science, Peter Drahos,"Regulatory capitalism depends heavily on science, but science faces epi-stemic critiques and crises of research integrity. These critiques and crises are outlined and then located within capitalism's general tragedy of commodification. Drawing on Marx's insights into the relationship between science, commodity production, and the machine age, the general tragedy of commodification is outlined. From here, the article shifts to discussing some well-known global public good problems relating to access to medicines and access to knowledge. The roots of these problems can be traced back to the way the institution of science has been bent toward processes of capital accumulation. The evidence we have from the history of science suggests that too often its research agendas have been set by capital and the demands of war-making capitalist states. The final part of the article considers whether the ideal of responsiveness might help us to reformulate the way in which we think about the responsibilities and duties of science. It focuses on human rights, citizen science, and the intellectual commons as potential sources of responsiveness. Responsiveness has been a fertile ideal for law and society theorists when it has come to theory building in law and regulation. It also has something to offer the debates around the crises of science.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-040220-065454,Oct-20,Vol. 16,327-342 ,

This article applies their framework to the realities of police work, identifying situations and assignments in which these factors are likely to influence officers’ behavior. These insights may identify opportunities for further empirical research into racial disparities in such contexts and may highlight institutional reforms and policy changes that could reduce officers’ vulnerability to risks that can result in racially unjust actions.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042633,Oct-20,Vol. 16,343-360 ,

Organizations have pressured high-level personnel accused of harassment to resign, or fired them outright, and they have created or revised their anti-harassment policies, complaint procedures, and training programs. This article reviews social science and legal scholarship on sex-based harassment, focusing on definitions and understandings of sexual (and sex-based) harassment, statistics on its prevalence, the consequences of harassment both for those who are subjected to it and for organizations, and explanations for why sex-based harassment persists. We then discuss the various steps that organizations have taken to reduce sex-based harassment and the social science literature on the effectiveness of those steps. We conclude that many organizational policies prevent liability more than they prevent harassment, in part because courts often fail to distinguish between meaningful compliance and the merely symbolic policies and procedures that do little to protect employees from harassment.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-031820-122129,Oct-20,Vol. 16,361-383 ,

We conclude that damage caps materially reduce claim frequency, payouts per claim, and total payouts. The effects of damage caps on malpractice premiums, physician supply, and defensive medicine are more modest. It is difficult to quantify the impact of reforms other than damage caps—partly because reforms are typically adopted as a package deal, and partly because of the limitations of the available data.

49,The Influence of Latino Ethnicity on the Imposition of the Death Penalty, Sheri Lynn Johnson,"With respect to African Americans, the history of racial discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty is well-known, and the persistence of racial disparities in the modern era of capital punishment is well-documented. In contrast, the influence of Latino ethnicity on the imposition of the death penalty has been studied very little. A review of the limited literature reveals evidence of discrimination against Latinos. Archival studies generally find ethnicity-of-victim discrimination, and some of those studies find ethnicity-of-defendant discrimination disadvantaging Latino defendants; these findings parallel the findings of the much more robust literature investigating bias against African American defendants and victims. The controlled experimental studies generally show both ethnicity-of-defendant and ethnicity-of-victim discrimination disadvantaging Latinos. Related literature investigating stereotypes, animosity, and discrimination in other criminal justice decisions further suggests the likelihood of ethnicity discrimination in the imposition of capital punishment, as well as the need for further research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-042220-111211,Oct-20,Vol. 16,421-431 ,
50,The Origins of Mass Incarceration: The Racial Politics of Crime and Punishment in the Post–Civil Rights Era, Katherine Beckett and  Megan Ming Francis,"This article examines the origins of US mass incarceration. Although it is clear that changes in policy and practice are the proximate drivers of the prison boom, researchers continue to explore—and disagree about—why crime control policy and practice changed in ways that fueled the growth of incarceration in all 50 states. One well-known account emphasizes the centrality of racial and electoral politics. This article more fully explicates the racial politics perspective, describes several friendly amendments to it, and explores a range of arguments that challenge it in more fundamental ways. In the end, we maintain that although mass incarceration has many drivers, it cannot be explained without reference to the centrality of racial politics; the importance of the crime issue to the GOP electoral strategy that emerged in the wake of the civil rights movement; and the nature of the decentralized, two-party electoral system in the United States.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110819-100304,Oct-20,Vol. 16,433-452 ,
51,Tool for Surveillance or Spotlight on Inequality? Big Data and the Law, Rebecca A. Johnson and  Tanina Rostain,"The rise of big data and machine learning is a polarizing force among those studying inequality and the law. Big data and tools like predictive modeling may amplify inequalities in the law, subjecting vulnerable individuals to enhanced surveillance. But these data and tools may also serve an opposite function, shining a spotlight on inequality and subjecting powerful institutions to enhanced oversight. We begin with a typology of the role of big data in inequality and the law. The typology asks questions—Which type of individual or institutional actor holds the data? What problem is the actor trying to use the data to solve?—that help situate the use of big data within existing scholarship on law and inequality. We then highlight the dual uses of big data and computational methods—data for surveillance and data as a spotlight—in three areas of law: rental housing, child welfare, and opioid prescribing. Our review highlights asymmetries where the lack of data infrastructure to measure basic facts about inequality within the law has impeded the spotlight function.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-061020-050543,Oct-20,Vol. 16,453-472 ,

Burke,"The concept of adversarial legalism has been widely used by scholars of law, public administration, public policy, political science, sociology, and Law and Society, but the varying ways in which the concept has been employed raise concerns that it has become stretched to the point of incoherence. We argue that adversarial legalism entails both a style, an everyday practice of dispute resolution and policy making with distinct attributes, and a structure of governance that can be compared to other structures of authority. Untangling these aspects of adversarial legalism allows us to make sense of its different uses and identify future avenues of inquiry. Despite its wide application, adversarial legalism is in fact underutilized, especially in studies aimed at understanding consequences of judicialization, legalization, and juridification in the United States and abroad.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-041620-083410,Oct-20,Vol. 16,473-487 ,

The disciplinary transformations ground, in part, her attention to the ways in which the everyday life of scholarship has led her to study the everyday life of the law. In this article, she describes her scholarly life through seven chapters of relatively distinct challenges and themes. Across the arc of her life, she identifies the recurrent influence of both serendipity and theoretical inference acting within the immediate constraints of family and personal capacity. Reading across descriptions of her work on regulatory enforcement, dispute negotiation and mediation, and popular legal culture and consciousness, she points to the necessity of reconciling on-the-ground vicissitudes of doing legal work with the theories and narratives social scientists construct to make sense of institutions and history. She muses on theoretical attempts to align the particular and the general, the micro and macro forces working in legal cultures, and concludes by celebrating the ubiquity of social ordering whose own momentum both seduces and frustrates social scientists.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113326,Oct-19,Vol. 15,1-20,

55,Could Populism Be Good for Constitutional Democracy?, Bojan Bugaric,"Populism is Janus-faced. There is not a single form of populism but rather a variety of different forms, each with profoundly different political consequences. Despite the current hegemony of authoritarian populism, a much different sort of populism is also possible: democratic and antiestablishment populism, which combines elements of liberal and democratic convictions. When we examine the relationship between populism and constitutional democracy, populism should not be considered in isolation from its host ideology. Examples of democratic, liberal, socially inclusive forms of populism quite clearly show that authoritarianism and anti-pluralism are not necessarily the key elements of populism. However, the paucity of democratic populism also suggests that we have to look at factors other than ideology to understand why nativist and authoritarian populism currently dominates the political scene. Without understanding the political economy of the populist revolt, it is difficult to understand the true roots of populism and, consequently, to devise an appropriate democratic alternative to authoritarian populism. The ascendancy of right-wing nationalist populism today is a symptom of the failure of progressive politics.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042927,Oct-19,Vol. 15,41-58 ,
56,Populism and Democratic Theory, Jane Mansbridge and  Stephen Macedo,"Commentators routinely describe “populism” as vague. Some argue that the early US populists, who coined the modern usage, were not populists. We disagree and identify this common conceptual core: the “people” in a moral battle against “elites.” The core definition fits all cases of populism: those on the left and right, those in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. In addition to this minimal common core, we identify strongly suggested and frequently correlated non-core characteristics. These include the people's homogeneity and exclusivity, direct rule, and nationalism, as well as a single leader, vilification of vulnerable out-groups, and impatience with deliberation. The US Populist Party and Spain's Podemos Party fit the core definition but have few of the other characteristics. The core can be good for democracy, we argue, while the associated characteristics are often dangerous. Populism in opposition can be good for democracy, while populism in power carries great risks.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042843,Oct-19,Vol. 15,59-77 ,

After setting out how I understand the rule of law and populism, I examine the ways in which contemporary populist discourse has challenged the rule of law through a variety of mechanisms—notably agenda setting, policy impact, influence on discretionary decisions, and convention trashing—considering the institutional and social conditions that conduce to strengthen or weaken these mechanisms in particular contexts. Finally, I consider the implications of the analysis for contemporary criminalization, assessing how many of the factors producing penal populism or overcriminalization are truly a product of populism.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042919,Oct-19,Vol. 15,79-96 ,
58,"Understanding Immigration Detention: Causes, Conditions, and Consequences", Emily Ryo,"During the summer of 2018, the US government detained thousands of migrant parents and their separated children pursuant to its zero-tolerance policy at the United States–Mexico border. The ensuing media storm generated unprecedented public awareness about immigration detention. The recency of this public attention belies a long-standing immigration enforcement practice that has generated a growing body of research in the past couple of decades. I take stock of this research, focusing on the causes, conditions, and consequences of immigration detention in the United States. I also discuss critical tasks for future research, including (a) examining the role of local governments, the private prison industry, and decision makers responsible for release decisions in maintaining the detention system; (b) extending the field of inquiry to less-visible detainee populations and detention facility guards and staff, for a fuller understanding of detention conditions; and (c) investigating not only direct but also indirect consequences of detention.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042743,Oct-19,Vol. 15,97-115 ,
59,"Law, Morality, and Health Care Professionals: A Multilevel Framework", Elizabeth Chiarello,"Socio-legal scholars have long been interested in the relationship between law and morality. This article uses a multilevel approach to understanding this relationship by focusing on health care professionals, key actors in an institution that covers broad swaths of social life and that serves as a key site of moral meaning making and practice. I demonstrate how morality and law interface differently at three levels: through daily social interaction, during which providers assess patients’ deservingness while patients attempt to present themselves as morally worthy; through organizational structures and processes that establish legalistic rules and bring diverse workers into shared space; and through field-level legal and moral infrastructures that shape frontline decision making and that change due to social movement mobilization. The article concludes by describing the benefits of a multilevel approach to examining the interplay between law, morality, and health care work and suggesting strategies for theoretically investigating these relationships more completely.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042853,Oct-19,Vol. 15,117-135 ,
60,Early US Prison History Beyond Rothman: Revisiting The Discovery of the Asylum, Ashley T. Rubin,"David J. Rothman's The Discovery of the Asylum, one of the first major works to critically interrogate the beginning of America's extensive reliance on institutionalization, effectively launched the contemporary field of prison history. Rothman traced the first modern prisons’ (1820s–1850s) roots to the post-Revolution social turmoil and reformers’ desire for perfectly ordered spaces. In the nearly 50 years since his pioneering work, several generations of historians, inspired by Rothman, have amassed a wealth of information about the early prisons, much of it correcting inaccuracies and blind spots in his account. This review examines the knowledge about the rise of the prison, focusing on this post-Rothman work. In particular, this review discusses this newer work organized into three categories: the claim that prisons were an invention of Jacksonian America, reformers’ other motivations for creating and supporting prisons, and the frequently gendered and racialized experiences of prisoners. The review closes by reflecting on the importance of prison history in the contemporary context and suggesting areas for future research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042808,Oct-19,Vol. 15,137-154 ,
61,Empirical Studies of Human Rights Law," Kevin L. Cope,  Cosette D. Creamer, and  Mila Versteeg","A growing body of empirical studies has provided important insights into our understanding of the causes and effects of codified human rights. Yet empirical research has treated human rights treaties and constitutional rights as separate domains, even though the two regimes offer many of the same rights protections and can interact and reinforce each other. In this article, we review these two bodies of literature, focusing on two lines of inquiry: studies that (a) treat rights commitments as the outcome to be explained and (b) examine the consequences of these commitments for state behavior. Some broad insights emerge from these literatures. First, the literatures adopt different orientations to explaining why states commit themselves to legal rights. Second, the effect of both human rights treaties and constitutions is usually small and contingent on certain legal and political environments. This review concludes by synthesizing debates over the most effective methods for measuring rights performance and for gauging causal effects.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-031123,Oct-19,Vol. 15,155-182 ,
62,Field-Based Methods of Research on Human Rights Violations, Daniel Rothenberg,"Field-based research lies at the heart of human rights discourse and practice. Yet, there is a lack of consistency and coherence in the methodologies used and inadequate transparency regarding research methods in most human rights reporting. This situation opens work up to multiple challenges as to quality, veracity, and legitimacy. Although there have been repeated calls for greater methodological rigor through universal standards, general principles, and guidelines, human rights research remains diverse, uncoordinated, and disparate. This article explores these issues in relation to fact-finding, measuring violations, truth commissions, and emerging tools and technologies. It reviews how methodological debates reflect significant divisions among disciplines, differences in goals and objectives, distinct interests among various actors and organizations working on these issues, and the overall complexity of human rights research. The article argues against implementing universal research practices and for creatively and openly engaging debates regarding field-based methods. Such efforts can provide an essential corrective to unquestioned assumptions, enable greater transparency, and improve the overall quality and comparative value of human rights research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-133939,Oct-19,Vol. 15,183-203 ,
63,From Food Chains to Food Webs: Regulating Capitalist Production and Consumption in the Food System, Christine Parker and  Hope Johnson,"This review addresses food as a topic of sociolegal studies. We show that the divide between production and consumption in law and social science is increasingly untenable in the context of contemporary globalizing, industrializing food chains underpinned by a productivist ideology and supported by a consumptogenic cultural economy. Sociolegal studies of food are well-suited to grappling with the complexity of production–consumption dynamics through regulatory governance studies of hybridized (public and private) supply chain standards. Yet we argue for an expanded focus on the embeddedness of food chains in social, political, and, importantly, ecological food webs. We suggest that sociolegal studies into ecologically based regulation, countermovements, and an expansive version of the human right to food (that includes nature and animals) can particularly contribute to an understanding of the possibilities for regulating capitalism by seeking to constrain globalizing, industrialized food chains.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042908,Oct-19,Vol. 15,205-225 ,

65,Intersectionality: From Theory to Practice," Hajer Al-Faham,  Angelique M. Davis, and  Rose Ernst","Intersectionality as a framework and praxis has gathered significance in law and the social sciences over the past 20 years. This article begins by reviewing how intersectionality has been conceptualized, as well as the implications of varying definitions attributed to intersectionality. We then explore applications of intersectionality, first in research that focuses on uncovering processes of differentiation and systems of inequality across a range of topics, including reproductive rights, colonization, religion, immigration, and political behavior. After examining these processes and systems, we turn to a second research approach that focuses on categories of difference and between-category relationships. We find that despite different views on conceptualization, application, and implications, intersectionality may nevertheless open new avenues of inquiry for scholars as well as opportunities for transformative coalition building in social movements and grassroots organizations.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042942,Oct-19,Vol. 15,247-265 ,
66,Law and Civilization: Norbert Elias as a Regulation Theorist, Robert van Krieken,"The German sociologist Norbert Elias developed a wide-ranging sociological analysis of the interconnections between processes of state formation, institutional dynamics, and individual subjectivity, or habitus, and the logic of their processes of transformation over time. His work has had significant impact on social scientific thought in a wide variety of fields, including the historical sociology of the self, violence, crime and punishment, organizations, emotions, sexuality, social control, and sport. His influence in legal scholarship, however, has concentrated in criminology, with only sporadic use of his ideas in relation to other topics in law and social science research. This review highlights the ways in which Elias can be read as a theorist of regulation by outlining (a) the core elements of Elias's “process-figurational” sociology and his analysis of processes of civilization and decivilization; (b) Elias's observations on law and state formation; (c) a selection of the sociolegal research related to his sociological approach, in fields such as crime and punishment, evolving modes of regulation, and international relations; and (d) the potential future directions in which Elias's process-figurational approach might move in sociolegal research and scholarship. These include the emotional dimensions of family law, human rights and humanitarianism, the intersections of legal evolution and broader processes of social change, legal pluralism and legal culture, tort law, constitutionalism, and the rule of law.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-030909,Oct-19,Vol. 15,267-288 ,

Different international, state, and local laws and policies play a part in refugee crises. On the one hand, then, it is important to theorize the role of the law in shaping different formations of displacement; on the other, it is also crucial to address how the people involved in these crises (government officials, street-level bureaucrats, forced migrants, and receiving populations) engage with the law. We highlight and develop three areas of sociolegal inquiry that can push forward the study of the law and politics of refuge: (a) the uneven geography shaping the global humanitarian machine; (b) the local contexts within which such a machine operates, interacting with different actors’ conceptualizations of justice; and (c) the distinct dilemmas that the urban environment poses to both refugees and humanitarians. Advancing these areas of sociolegal inquiry requires enriching established theoretical sources in refugee studies with both neglected ones, such as postcolonial theory and Pierre Bourdieu's sociology of forced displacement, and newer ones, such as Didier Fassin's anthropology of morality and pragmatic sociology of ordinary judgments of fairness.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042609,Oct-19,Vol. 15,289-310 ,

Warner,"Despite a long history of reform efforts, college students remain vulnerable to sexual harassment and assault on campus. This article surveys that history from the 1970s to the present, including a flurry of enforcement activity under President Obama and a backlash and reversed course under Trump. Many of the systems—for example law, education, and public health—designed to ameliorate the epidemic of campus sexual assault have failed to do so. These failures have been particularly pronounced for victims who experience multiple intersecting inequalities. The resulting frustration with legal remedies through campus Title IX processes and the criminal and civil justice system has spurred a new interest in strategies to prevent sexual assault in the first place. Recent political developments, including the #MeToo movement, suggest a potential for democratic political accountability to make progress where legal reform efforts and campus prevention programming have thus far been unsuccessful.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-031308,Oct-19,Vol. 15,311-333 ,
69,Legal Consciousness Reconsidered, Lynette J. Chua and  David M. Engel,"Legal consciousness is a vibrant research field attracting growing numbers of scholars worldwide. Yet differing assumptions about aims and methods have generated vigorous debate, typically resulting from a failure to recognize that three different clusters of scholars—identified here as the Identity, Hegemony, and Mobilization schools—are pursuing different goals and deploying the concept of legal consciousness in different ways. Scholarship associated with these three schools demonstrates that legal consciousness is actually a flexible paradigm with multiple applications rather than a monolithic approach. Furthermore, a new generation of scholars has energized the field in recent years, focusing on marginalized peoples and non-Western settings. Through their findings, and as a result of broader trends across the social sciences, relational legal consciousness has taken on greater importance. Legal consciousness research should be imagined on a continuum ranging from individualistic conceptualizations of thought and action to interactive, co-constitutive approaches.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042717,Oct-19,Vol. 15,335-353 ,
70,Legal Mobilization and Authoritarianism, Lynette J. Chua,"Studies about authoritarianism build the foundation of legal mobilization scholarship and continue to advance this area of sociolegal research. The contributions of these studies become apparent when we view authoritarianism as a phenomenon found in all societies. Authoritarian regimes exist as nation states and as enclaves, such as subnational territories, institutions, and social spaces. Scholars who examine whether and how people use the law in diverse authoritarian settings bring out the malleable, situational, and plural nature of legal power. Law, in collaboration or complicity with other sources of power, can impede legal mobilization. Nevertheless, individuals and groups can use the law to challenge authoritarianism by carrying out formal, quasi-formal, or nonformal legal actions, an array of strategies and tactics that encompass more than courtroom litigation. Overall, the outcomes of legal mobilization under authoritarianism are mixed and paradoxical. Sometimes law can benefit disadvantaged populations living under authoritarianism. However, law is also criticized for being ineffective, even harmful. Examined in light of the notion that authoritarianism is all over, legal mobilization research offers keen reflections on the study of legal power.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-043026,Oct-19,Vol. 15,355-376 ,

73,On Juror Decision Making: An Empathic Inquiry, Dan Simon,This review examines the workings of jurors deciding criminal cases. It seeks not to commend or condemn jury decision making but rather to offer an empathic exploration of the task that jurors face in exercising their fact-finding duty. Reconstructing criminal events in the courtroom amounts to a difficult feat under the best of circumstances. The task becomes especially complicated under the taxing conditions of criminal adjudication: the often substandard evidence presented in court; the paucity of the investigative record; types of evidence that are difficult to decipher; the unruly decision-making environment of the courtroom; and mental gymnastics required to meet the normative demands of criminal adjudication. The critical spotlight is directed not at the jurors but at the conditions under which we expect them to fulfill their duty and at the unverified reverence in which their verdicts are held. The article concludes with a set of recommendations designed to assist our fact-finders in meeting the societal expectations of this solemn task.,Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042658,Oct-19,Vol. 15,415-435 ,

75,Prosecution and Punishment of Corporate Criminality, Mihailis E. Diamantis and  William S. Laufer,"This article offers an overview of and commentary on the US approach to corporate prosecution and punishment. Though the United States purports to have a vigorous system of corporate criminal law enforcement, one could reasonably ask whether that system actually takes corporate crime seriously. Corporate prosecutions, convictions, and punishment continue to be rare events. Sanctions leveraged against corporations range from those whose effectiveness remains unproved, to those that are provably ineffective, to those that are conceptually and practically incoherent. One could also reasonably ask to what extent the United States even has a corporate criminal law to enforce. The recent history of corporate criminal law enforcement reflects a discernable shift in discretion from judges to prosecutors. This period is marked by the importance of extralegal prosecutorial guidelines, the absence of controlling case law, large gaps in statutory law, and long-called-for law reforms. One result is a systematic shift from reliance on public enforcement to private self-regulation. Not only are the resulting costs to the private sector substantial and growing, but the problems with relying on corporations to police themselves are plain to see. Amid these challenges, the thirst for private-sector responsibility and accountability should motivate continued debate over the prosecution and punishment of corporations.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-031212,Oct-19,Vol. 15,453-472 ,

This article reviews the legal, social scientific, and reformist mechanisms that maintain the racial innocence of one particular site: the US carceral state. With its routine dehumanization, violence, and stunning levels of racial disparity, the carceral state should be a hard test case for the willful unknowing of obvious devastation. Nonetheless, the law presumes “no racism,” condones racial profiling, and interprets racial disparity in policing and imprisonment as evidence of true racial difference in criminality, not discrimination.

78,Right-to-Work Laws: Ideology and Impact, Ruben J. Garcia,"The debates about right-to-work (RTW) laws have raged for decades. Conservatives have long argued that a freedom principle prohibits employees from being required to pay dues even when a union represents them. Unions and their allies counter that RTW laws are actually intended to minimize the bargaining and political power of labor unions. This article outlines the ideology and impact of RTW laws in the United States. As constitutional challenges to fair share fees continue and state legislatures gradually pass RTW laws, there are many studies on the impact of RTW laws on wages and unionization, but the impact on politics is more mixed. This article analyzes the data nationally but also points to some conditions in which RTW laws may not have the impact that either their proponents or detractors predict. Literature on the topic has considered the following questions: (a) whether wages and working conditions in RTW states are lower than in non-RTW states, (b) whether such laws have the intent and effect of weakening worker-friendly candidates politically, and (c) whether legal interpretations of agency fees or fair share fees are correct. Drawing on the literature in each of these areas, I explore areas of future research and offer conclusions about the state of the literature, as well as the public perceptions of RTW.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042951,Oct-19,Vol. 15,509-519 ,

Ben Cohen,"Since 1972, the Supreme Court has experimented with regulation of the death penalty, seeking the illusive goals of consistency, reliability, and fairness. In this century, the court held that the Sixth Amendment prohibited judges from making findings necessary to impose a death sentence. Separately, the court held that the Eighth Amendment safeguarded evolving standards of decency as measured by national consensus. In this article, we discuss the role of judges in death determinations, identifying jurisdictions that initially (post 1972) allowed judge sentencing and naming the individuals who today remain under judge-imposed death sentences. The decisions guaranteeing a jury determination have so far been applied only to cases that have not undergone initial review in state courts. Key questions remain unresolved, including whether the evolving standards of decency permit the execution of more than 100 individuals who were condemned to death by judges without a jury's death verdict before implementation of the rules that now require unanimous jury votes.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042834,Oct-19,Vol. 15,539-557 ,

Next, it surveys the responses to the double-distortion argument. These responses appear to have had only limited success in challenging the sturdy reputation of the double-distortion argument.

Goldbach,"In examining how laws and legal institutions move across jurisdictions, comparative law scholars have employed the metaphor of a legal transplant to conceptualize both the hazards and benefits of taking in another legal system's rules. As law and society scholars become increasingly interested in the international domain, they will naturally seek out disciplines that have grappled with issues of law and culture, diffusion of governance structures, and the social processes involved in transnational lawmaking. We can thus learn a great deal from the rich literature on legal transplants. However, we should also be wary of its anemic examination of relations of power and strive to employ empirical methods to measure the social forces and factors involved.

We urgently need more research on disclosure. Regulatory complexity makes studying campaign finance disclosure daunting. It also creates so-called dark money and anonymous speech online. Scholars must understand the existing regulatory loopholes as they plan studies to avoid biased estimates and understand the conditions in which their results generalize to a broader population. The court's disclosure jurisprudence is thin and based on largely unproven assumptions. As the research on campaign finance disclosure matures, scholars should take a broad view of the costs and benefits of disclosure, rather than the narrow, court-led focus many studies have had until now.

Yet little of this research has documented variation across facilities in conditions of confinement or how these variations in conditions of confinement shape the consequences of incarceration for inmates and ex-inmates, their families, and their communities. Also, the conditions of confinement that have to this point been considered represent a very incomplete portrait of the range of conditions of confinement inmates could face. In this review, we fill this gap in four ways. First, we provide a partial overview of possible variations in conditions of confinement. Second, we use data from multiple years of the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails and the Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities to provide an assessment of how much conditions of confinement vary across American jails, state prisons, and federal prisons, with an emphasis on variation within as well as between facility types.

Where scholarship has focused on factors internal to prisons, explanations have often focused less on individual actors or correctional influence and more on processes, such as routinization, legalization, and risk management. This article argues for the importance of an additional explanatory factor in understanding the phenomenon of mass incarceration: the internal and relatively individualized influence of correctional officials, especially mid-level bureaucrats, who exercise autonomy and authority not only over prisoners and prison policy implementation but over policy initiation.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-031009,Oct-18,Vol. 14,49-68 ,
88,Critiques of Human Rights, Malcolm Langford,"Empirical critiques of human rights have reached a crescendo. Despite their centrality in late modernity, human rights face claims of irrelevance and predictions of demise. These social science–inflected assessments follow a familiar repertoire of critique. Concerns surrounding sociological legitimacy, material effectiveness, and distributive equality are foregrounded and undergirded by a growing body of empirical evidence, especially in sociology, political science, and anthropology but also in economics and social psychology. However, the critique has also catalyzed a counter-critique. A contending body of evidence accompanied by mid-level theorizing suggests that the turn to human rights has been more successful than imagined. This paper argues that it is difficult to reach any definitive conclusion given the role of normative biases in the research and a failure to agree on common benchmarks for evaluation. Nonetheless, with an emerging postliberal order, and a deepened concern over respect for human rights in both democracies and autocracies, critiques and counter-critiques deserve consideration in ensuring that the political project of human rights is both effective and equitable.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113807,Oct-18,Vol. 14,69-89 ,
89,From Nudge to Culture and Back Again: Coalface Governance in the Regulated Organization, Ruthanne Huising and  Susan S. Silbey,"The range of organizational responses to regulatory requirements is often explained by describing the organization as a monolithic actor interacting with external agents. We look inside regulated organizations, recognizing them as a web of transactions and norms, to examine how formal and informal organizational practices transform regulatory requirements into normalized activity. This article identifies four levers used at the coalface—or frontline—of the organization to encourage compliance in organizations: nudge (individual), bureaucracy (roles, rules, and procedures), relational governance (network), and organizational culture (assumptions, values, and artifacts). We map the range of research on coalface governance while displaying the assumptions and implications of each lever often embedded in recommendations to policy makers or organizational managers. We offer this continuum of techniques to invite a richer conversation about ways of pursuing compliance in organizations.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-084716,Oct-18,Vol. 14,91-114 ,
90,Law and the Dead Body: Is a Corpse a Person or a Thing?, Ellen Stroud,"The central puzzle of the law of the dead is that a corpse is both a person and a thing. A dead human body is a material object—a messy, maybe dangerous, perhaps valuable, often useful, and always tangible thing. But a dead human being is also something very different: It is also my father, and my friend, perhaps my child, and some day, me. For even the most secular among us, a human corpse is at the least a very peculiar and particular kind of thing. Scholars generally divide the law of the dead body into the three intertwined realms of defining, using, and disposing of the dead, and debates in each realm center on where and how to draw the line between person and object. The thing-ness of the dead human body is never stable or secure.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113500,Oct-18,Vol. 14,115-125 ,
91,Law's Underdog: A Call for More-than-Human Legalities, Irus Braverman,"Questions pertaining to the role of nonhumans in law shed light on some of the most fundamental assumptions and constructions of contemporary modern law. I start by reviewing the traditions of animal welfare and animal rights in legal studies and by discussing the constitutional frameworks that contend with the animal. Then, I move beyond the individual-based discourse of much existing animal law to contemplate ecological traditions that consider nonhuman populations and species as well as land ethics and ecosystem management. Next, I review the rich literature that has emerged in the last two decades in critical theory, mainly posthumanism and its subtraditions of animal geographies and multispecies ethnography. Finally, I sketch visions of more-than-human legalities that push beyond the limitations of existing (neo)liberal legal traditions, pausing to consider what ocean, or blue, legalities might look like. Throughout, I argue that we need to move toward a dynamic and pluralistic approach that acknowledges the myriad ways of being in the world, their significance to law, and, in turn, law's significance to these other modes of existence.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-030820,Oct-18,Vol. 14,127-144 ,
92,"Norms, Normativity, and the Legitimacy of Justice Institutions: International Perspectives", Jonathan Jackson,"This article reviews the international evidence on the potential nature, sources, and consequences of police and legal legitimacy. In brief, I find that procedural justice is the strongest predictor of police legitimacy in most of the countries under investigation, although normative judgements about fair process may—in some contexts—be crowded out by public concerns about police effectiveness and corruption, the scale of the crime problem, and the association of the police with a historically oppressive and underperforming state. Legitimacy tends to be linked to people's willingness to cooperate with the police, with only a small number of national exceptions. There is also a fair amount of evidence that people who say they feel a moral duty to obey the law tend also to report complying with the law in the past or intending to comply with the law in the future. The main argument is, however, that international enthusiasm for testing procedural justice theory is outpacing methodological rigor and theoretical clarity. On the one hand, the lack of attention to methodological equivalence is holding back the development of a properly comparative cross-national analysis. On the other hand, the literature would benefit from (a) greater delineation between legitimation (the bases on which citizens judge the rightfulness of an institution) and legitimacy (the acceptance or rejection of the rightfulness of an institution and the normatively grounded duty to obey), (b) stronger differentiation between police and legal legitimacy, and (c) more attention given to isolating the mechanisms through which rightfulness and consent motivate cooperation and compliance.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113734,Oct-18,Vol. 14,145-165 ,
93,Rule-of-Law Ethnography, Nick Cheesman,"This review outlines an emerging agenda for ethnographic interpretation of the rule of law. From a survey of studies done on the rule of law in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas, the review identifies four general characteristics of this mode of inquiry, namely, that it is located, relational, and comparative and has extrinsic value. It offers three nonexhaustive reasons for interpreting the rule of law ethnographically, which are as a counterhegemonic practice, in response to counterintuitive observations, and as a means to do constitutive theorizing. Contending that ethnographic work on the rule of law involves some kind of stance toward both research subjects and object of inquiry, the review advocates for the exercise of passionate humility: a conviction about the rule of law tempered by willingness to be proven wrong through inquiries in critical proximity with socially and politically mediated facts. Rule-of-law ethnography's possibility lies in its attending to the relationship between what is claimed in the rule of law's name and what is realized, not to make the idea look foolish, but to show how it emerges and why it persists through struggle.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-030900,Oct-18,Vol. 14,167-184 ,

Drawing on environmental law, green criminology, and international relations, the article examines the development of environmental security scholarship over recent decades and shows similarities and differences in perspectives across the three disciplines. It demonstrates that the Anthropocene represents a significant challenge for thinking about and responding to security and the environment. It argues a rethinking is needed, and this can benefit from reaching across the disciplinary divide in three key areas that have become a shared focus of attention and debate regarding security in the Anthropocene. These are, first, examining the implications of the Anthropocene for our understanding of the environment and security; second, addressing and resolving contests between environmental securities; and third, developing new governance responses that mix polycentric and state-backed regulation to bring safety and security to the planet.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-030945,Oct-18,Vol. 14,185-203 ,
95,Styles of Argumentation in Judicial Opinions (Legitimating Judicial Decisions), Nicholas Scurich,"This article focuses on how judges present arguments in written opinions and whether the predominant style of argumentation promotes the legitimacy of the judiciary. Judicial opinions are habitually unequivocal, overstated, and lacking of any doubt that the singularly correct decision was reached. Studies examining the effect of argumentation in judicial opinions are limited but generally suggest that furnishing a monolith of reasons does not have persuasive power. In contrast, opinions that acknowledge the complexity and indeterminacy of the decision do have a salutary effect on legitimacy for those who disagree with the outcome of the decision. However, a much larger and more consistent finding is that legitimacy is determined by whether one agrees or disagrees with the outcome of the decision, not the reasons underlying the outcome. The study of public reactions to judicial opinions is important and in its infancy. Avenues for future empirical research are discussed.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-031050,Oct-18,Vol. 14,205-218 ,

Recognizing this, interest groups and other entities lobby judges in an attempt to translate their policy preferences into law. One of the primary vehicles for doing so is the amicus curiae brief. Through these legal briefs, amici can attempt to influence judicial outcomes while attending to organizational maintenance concerns. This article examines scholarship on the use of amicus briefs pertaining to five main areas: (a) why amicus briefs are filed, (b) who files amicus briefs and in what venues, (c) the content of amicus briefs, (d) the influence of amicus briefs, and (e) normative issues implicated in the amicus practice. In addition to presenting a critical review of the scholarship in these areas, this article also provides suggestions for future research on amicus briefs.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-031248,Oct-18,Vol. 14,219-237 ,

Drastic contraction has also occurred: The rate of jury trials is at an all-time low, dampening the signal that jury verdicts provide to the justice system, reducing the opportunity for jury service, and potentially threatening the legitimacy of judgments. At the same time, new areas of jury research have been producing important explanations for how the jury goes about reaching its verdict in response to challenging questions, like how to assess damages. Yet the persistent focus on individual juror judgments as opposed to decision making by the jury as a group leaves unanswered important questions about how jury performance is influenced by a primary distinctive feature of the jury: the deliberation process.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113618,Oct-18,Vol. 14,239-258 ,

99,The Lessons and Limitations of Experiments in Democratic Deliberation, John Gastil,"Experiments are essential to the practice of democratic deliberation, which itself is an experimental remedy to the problem of self-governance. This field, however, is constrained by the impossibility of conducting ecologically valid experiments that take into account the full complexity of deliberative theory, which spans different levels of analysis and has a multidimensional variable at its core. Nonetheless, informative patterns have emerged from the dozens of lab studies, survey experiments, and quasi-experiments in the field conducted to date. This body of work shows the feasibility of gathering diverse samples of people to deliberate, but it also underscores the difficulties that arise in deliberation, including extreme disagreement, poor conflict management, and how a lack of diversity can forestall meaningful disagreement. When public engagement strategies and discussion formats mitigate those hazards, deliberation can improve participants’ understanding of issues, sharpen their judgments, and change their attitudes toward civic engagement. Well-publicized deliberative minipublics can even influence wider public opinion and voting intentions.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113639,Oct-18,Vol. 14,271-291 ,

Billed as a bipartisan boost to market competition, this technocratic policy agenda rests on thin empirical foundations. Studies of the wage effects of licensing rarely couple this analysis of its putative costs with convincing analysis of the benefits of the professional or vocational education validated via licensure. While some licensing rules may be onerous and excessive, licensing rules are inadequate or underenforced in other labor markets. Furthermore, by limiting labor market entry, occupational licensing rules, like minimum wage and labor laws, can help stabilize working- and middle-class wages. Although current antitrust law provides an ideological framework for technocratic attacks on licensing, it is fundamentally unsuited for evaluation of labor markets. Contemporary antitrust law's arcane concept of efficiency reflects neither the legislative objectives animating the antitrust statutes nor popular understanding of what competition policy should do.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-112116-014728,Oct-18,Vol. 14,309-327 ,

The institutions and agreements may be functional or territorial in nature. International regime complexity refers to international political systems of global governance that emerge because of the coexistence of rule density and regime complexes. This article highlights insights and questions that emerge from the last 15 years of scholarship on the politics of international regime complexity, explaining why regime complexes arise, what factors sustain them, and the range of political effects regime complexity creates.

This review explores two clusters of debate regarding the sharing economy and seeks to discern the lines of a productive dialogue between them. It suggests that the current state of scholarship on law in the sharing economy is a complex and asymmetrical mix of narrative articulation and empirical exploration. The first cluster focuses on an on-demand commercial vision of the sharing economy and is generating an exploding legal literature largely not grounded on empirical research. This coexists with an emergent social science literature focused on a solidarity-inflected version of the sharing economy, which, however, pays little or no explicit attention to law or legality. Each cluster of debate is first separately explored, after which three sites of détente are identified where these trajectories edge toward each other: urban governance, sociolegal accounts of the interplay between enterprise diversity and regulation, and reconfigurations of property law. Common to all three is an appreciation of collective economic agency as of equal importance to regulatory responses.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-031201,Oct-18,Vol. 14,351-366 ,

The focus is mainly on empirical evidence from social psychology, with additions from related areas like cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and other social sciences. After briefly reviewing empirical findings on perceptions of property at the level of the individual person, I examine how social relationships shape perceptions about ownership and exchange of property, as well as the boundaries of the broad category of property. Finally, I explore one important type of socially embedded property—the home—and how social psychological conceptions of property as embedded in social relationships have clashed with the development of the legal doctrine of eminent domain.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113627,Oct-18,Vol. 14,367-380 ,

The latest of these challenges is the claim for broadening its scope to incorporate social justice– and development-related matters. And in just a few years, the possibility and adequacy of thicker or more holistic conceptions of transitional justice have become mainstream. Nonetheless, since their beginnings these new approaches have been subject to criticism from both within and outside the field. This article describes the trajectory of the scholarly debate on expanding transitional justice to encompass socioeconomic concerns, as well as its main limitations. It starts by exploring the main reasons that led to the historical marginalization of socioeconomic concerns in transitional justice theory and practice. It then considers the rationale for the implementation of broader approaches to transitional justice and closes with a discussion of the main challenges and limitations these proposals face.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-031259,Oct-18,Vol. 14,397-410 ,

The resultant case law, culminating in the US Supreme Court case Brown v. EMA (2011), demonstrated court skepticism of the science linking violent games to harm in minors. Such skepticism was increasingly confirmed as numerous newer studies could not link violent games to socially relevant outcomes. In more recent years, there has been a newer focus on sexist games and the harm these might cause. This field appears at risk for repeating some of the problems of the violent game field, including exaggeration of mixed findings, lack of curiosity regarding null findings, and unreliable research designs.

The article contrasts the positions taken by Nagin & Telep (2017) and Tyler (2017).

Telep,"This article reviews the evidence on whether procedurally just treatment of citizens by agents of the criminal justice system, usually the police, has the effect of increasing the citizen's compliance with the law. In brief, we find that perception-based studies consistently show that citizen perceptions of procedurally just treatment are closely tied to perceptions of police legitimacy, and that with only a few exceptions perceptions of legitimacy are strongly associated with legal compliance. However, what has not been established is whether these associations reflect a causal connection whereby changes in policies that are effective in changing actual procedurally just treatment of citizens by police and others lead to changes in legal compliance and perceived legitimacy. Three priority areas for future research are identified: (a) devising and testing a theory of the cumulative effects of experience and community and situational context on perceptions of procedurally just treatment and perceptions of legitimacy, (b) filling out and testing a theory of the circumstances in which improved perceptions of legitimacy translate into greater legal compliance, and (c) designing and evaluating policies and training protocols that are effective in translating the constituent components of procedurally just treatment into improved legal compliance.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113310,Oct-17,Vol. 13,5-28,

However, large literatures in social psychology and management make a plausible case for the value of applying this model to policing. These literatures suggest that it is likely that (a) the practices of the police can be crafted to raise perceptions of procedural justice, (b) police training can alter officer behavior, and (c) redesigning police organizations internally can motivate their members to treat community members more fairly. A focus on legitimacy highlights the virtues of consensual models of policing. Consensual models are found to motivate public cooperation in fighting crime and to heighten identification with and engagement in communities. Consequently, legitimacy is the most promising framework for discussing changing the goals of policing and moving from a police force model to a police service model.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113318,Oct-17,Vol. 13,29-53 ,

112,50 Years of “Obedience to Authority”: From Blind Conformity to Engaged Followership, S. Alexander Haslam and  Stephen D. Reicher,"Despite being conducted half a century ago, Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority remain the most well-known, most controversial, and most important in social psychology. Yet in recent years, increased scrutiny has served to question the integrity of Milgram's research reports, the validity of his explanation of the phenomena he reported, and the broader relevance of his research to processes of collective harm-doing. We review these debates and argue that the main problem with received understandings of Milgram's work arises from seeing it as an exploration of obedience. Instead, we argue that it is better understood as providing insight into processes of engaged followership, in which people are prepared to harm others because they identify with their leaders' cause and believe their actions to be virtuous. We review evidence that supports this analysis and shows that it explains the behavior not only of Milgram's participants but also of his research assistants and of the textbook writers and teachers who continue to reproduce misleading accounts of his work.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113710,Oct-17,Vol. 13,59-78 ,

This article summarizes and synthesizes this growing body of work. It begins by addressing the conceptualization of the local, which to date has been loosely and ambiguously defined. Rather than viewing the local as a spatial level or as based on tradition, the review suggests that transitional justice approaches are local to the extent that (a) survivors have agency and power and (b) their experiences and outcomes are prioritized.

CCL, for its part, is aimed at constructing constitutional law doctrine, understanding the methodologies of judicial recourse to foreign law, and investigating how similar-seeming constitutional principles take on different meanings in different legal systems. Comparative judicial politics, by contrast, consists of a range of political science research on the origins and ongoing dynamics of judicially enforced constitutionalism. The recent call for CCL to progress into comparative constitutional studies should accordingly be treated with caution.

Pursuant to the theory of the National Surveillance State, because of the routinized and administrative nature of government-led surveillance, normalized mass surveillance is viewed as justified under crime and counterterrorism policy rationales. This article contends that the Cybersurveillance State is the successor to the National Surveillance State. The Cybersurveillance State harnesses technologies that fuse biometric and biographic data for risk assessment, embedding bureaucratized biometric cybersurveillance within the Administrative State. In ways that are largely invisible, the Cybersurveillance State constructs digital avatars for administrative governance objectives and targets digital data deemed suspicious.

Between November 2012 and November 2016, voters in eight states passed ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana sales for nonmedical purposes—covering one-fifth of the US population. These changes are unprecedented but are not independent of the changes in medical marijuana laws that have occurred over the past 20 years. This article suggests five ways in which the passage and implementation of medical marijuana laws smoothed the transition to nonmedical legalization in the United States: (a) They demonstrated the efficacy of using voter initiatives to change marijuana supply laws, (b) enabled the psychological changes needed to destabilize the “war on drugs” policy stasis, (c) generated an evidence base that could be used to downplay concerns about nonmedical legalization, (d) created a visible and active marijuana industry, and (e) revealed that the federal government would allow state and local jurisdictions to generate tax revenue from marijuana.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-084851,Oct-17,Vol. 13,181-202 ,

Furthermore, judges sometimes rely on facts outside the record and rule more favorably toward litigants who are more sympathetic or with whom they share demographic characteristics. On the whole, judges are excellent decision makers and sometimes resist common errors of judgment that influence ordinary adults. The weight of the evidence, however, suggests that judges are vulnerable to systematic deviations from the ideal of judicial impartiality.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-085032,Oct-17,Vol. 13,203-229 ,
120,"Law, Innovation, and Collaboration in Networked Economy and Society", Yochai Benkler,"Over the past 25 years, social science research in diverse fields has shifted its best explanations of innovation from (a) atomistic invention and development by individuals, corporate or natural, to networked learning; (b) market-based innovation focused on material self-interest to interaction between market and nonmarket practices under diverse motivations; and (c) property rights exclusively to interaction between property and commons. These shifts have profound implications for how we must think about law and innovation. Patents, copyrights, noncompete agreements, and trade secret laws are all optimized for an increasingly obsolete worldview. Strong intellectual property impedes, rather than facilitates, innovation when we understand that knowledge flows in learning networks, mixing of market and nonmarket models and motivations, and weaving of commons with property are central to the innovation process.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113340,Oct-17,Vol. 13,231-250 ,
121,Managing Street-Level Arbitrariness: The Evidence Base for Public Sector Quality Improvement, Daniel E. Ho and  Sam Sherman,"Decentralized decisions among government officials can cause dramatic inconsistencies in bureaucratic decision making. This article provides a synthetic review of the evidence base for improving the quality of bureaucratic decisions and reducing such street-level arbitrariness. First, we offer a typology to unify quality assurance management techniques often treated in distinct scholarly literatures. This synthesis reveals common challenges but also points to novel hybrid solutions that borrow across management techniques. Second, although empirical evidence is limited, our review suggests that ongoing management techniques, such as monitoring, peer review, and pay-for-performance, are more successful than ex post techniques, such as audits and appeals. Third, performance measurement and pay exacerbate the quantity–quality trade-off long opined about in public administration. We offer suggestions for future directions—most importantly, the vital role of academic-agency research collaborations in crafting quality improvement efforts—to address this endemic challenge to bureaucracy and rule of law.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113608,Oct-17,Vol. 13,251-272 ,
122,Measuring the Impact of Human Rights: Conceptual and Methodological Debates, Christopher J. Fariss and  Geoff Dancy,"Fifty years ago, the world had very few human rights laws and very little information on human rights violations. Today, the situation could not be more different. The world is awash in laws and indicators of legal violations, and two perspectives have developed to explain their relationship. The factualist approach measures whatever information is available, however imperfectly, and assumes that the resulting indicators are valid representations of the theoretical concepts of interest. The constructivist approach reminds us that these processes are not independent and that a science of law and human rights is fallible. Though the conclusions from these perspectives diverge radically, they agree on a central notion: that international human rights law has contributed very little to social progress. We disagree and offer an alternative, constitutive approach that both accepts the critique of indicators and offers a way forward that encourages scholars to treat measurement itself as an object of theorizing and inquiry.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113333,Oct-17,Vol. 13,273-294 ,

Achieving health equity and eliminating health disparities is not without its challenges and will require interventions and approaches that focus on improving opportunity structures for racial/ethnic minorities. We provide a brief overview of the literature documenting black/white differences in health across the life course. We then discuss current conceptual models guiding this research and discuss the importance of translating legal theory—specifically, critical race approaches—to both the study of health disparities and the development of interventions to address them. We conclude with examples of research that incorporate, although not explicitly, aspects of critical race theory and discuss how this approach can be leveraged in future studies.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-085002,Oct-17,Vol. 13,313-329 ,

This review focuses on mechanisms to explain this persistent pattern. We begin with policy making, a mechanism fundamental to all the others. We then examine one particularly important policy, the carceral state, which can be described as the most important policy response to the civil rights era. A significant body of scholarship on employment discrimination presents a site for explaining the transformation of law on the books into the law in action. Finally, we review scholarship on the persistence of segregation and concentrated neighborhood disadvantage and their attendant impact on racial inequality. We conclude with two themes that deserve special emphasis: the need for theory drawing these fields together and our need, above all at this moment in our history, for public scholarship changing the discourse, politics, and law perpetuating racial inequality.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113452,Oct-17,Vol. 13,331-350 ,

Over the past two decades, LSS scholars have increasingly turned for such accounts to the field known as science and technology studies (STS). This article reviews the LSS literature that draws on STS. Our discussion is divided into two primary sections. We first discuss LSS literature that draws on STS because it deals with issues in which law and science interact. We then discuss literature that draws on STS because it sees law as analogous to science as a knowledge-producing institution amenable to social science analysis. We suggest that through both of these avenues STS can encourage a newly critical view within LSS scholarship.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113550,Oct-17,Vol. 13,351-371 ,

It provides a compelling example of how nonstate actors, relying on principled positions rather than resources, can alter the course of global policy making. The Church's authority rests on three distinct features: (a) independence from the nation-state system; (b) a centralized transnational bureaucracy; and (c) its enduring ideology. In this review, we elaborate on the Church's role in promoting peace, serving the poor, and blocking the institutionalization of access to contraception and abortion. Church ideology finds strong secular counterparts in the cases of promoting peace and support for the poor. It is on shakier ground when it ventures into gender issues, which it has done with zeal in recent years. Its primary allies on gender issues have been other religious organizations and Islamic states, reinforcing the religious rather than human rights basis for Church positions. The Church's role as the moral authority in the secular United Nations system is therefore less clear when it speaks about gender and sexuality.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-084534,Oct-17,Vol. 13,395-411 ,

This article also tracks the litigation epidemic in countries like Colombia and Brazil, where the escalation of health rights lawsuits is threatening the financial stability of health systems and the fair allocation of scarce health resources. It concludes by discussing a fundamental challenge confronting the field, namely, how to look upstream for new approaches to the right to health to reinstate litigation and adjudication as mechanisms to promote more equitable health systems.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113303,Oct-17,Vol. 13,431-449 ,

Rogers,"Perhaps few decisions have more of an impact on the operational functioning of the criminal justice system than the decision by victims of crime to notify the police. Researchers in the United States and abroad have found that victims often choose not to mobilize the criminal law in the aftermath of a victimization event. A large percentage of property and violent crimes never appear in official crime data estimates. Most remain hidden in the dark figure of crime. Victim nonreporting has numerous implications for criminal justice system processing, crime control policy, and substantive research on the causes and correlates of crime. Studies have long sought to identify the victim-, incident-, and community-based mechanisms that might account for patterns of police notification. Although several important findings have emerged, critical questions remain unanswered. This article provides a critical overview of the determinants of victim nonreporting and charts potential avenues for future research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-084510,Oct-17,Vol. 13,451-469 ,

The literature on social science in SSM litigation is in its formative stage. This article reviews key SSM cases—including the three SSM trials and recent US Supreme Court cases—and describes how litigants and other interested parties invoked social science to address several key points related to legal recognition of SSM.

It argues that recent years have seen a broad sociological turn in constitutional theory, such that sociological constitutionalism now forms a distinct field of legal research. This is due to the general increase in the importance of constitutionalism in different national societies across the globe. This is also due to the emergence of new patterns of constitutional formation, both within and beyond national societies, resulting from the interaction between national and domestic constitutional law. The article separates different constitutional-sociological approaches into two categories: those with a primarily national, and those with a primarily transnational focus. Overall, however, it claims that sociological constitutionalism is driven primarily by engagement with transnational law, and the main insights in this field relate, in different ways, to global processes of transnational norm formation.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113518,Oct-17,Vol. 13,493-513 ,

Literature on the topic has taken up five questions: how labor unions affect the passage of protective laws and regulations; how they affect the outcomes that regulators target; how they affect the intensity of regulatory enforcement; the specific activities and channels of influence they use to influence regulated outcomes; and the role they play in self-regulation. Drawing on empirical literature from the domains listed, I review and analyze literature on each of these questions and offer several conclusions and suggestions for future research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121416,Oct-17,Vol. 13,515-534 ,

For this reason, this article proposes grouping them under the more general title of sociopolitical legal studies (SLS). This general label includes a collection of transdisciplinary research, theories, and studies that view law as a sociopolitical phenomenon central to the understanding of power and society. The concept of SLS reveals the existence of a transversal ground between three academic disciplines: sociology of law, legal theory, and sociolegal studies, which, in spite of multiple connections, rarely communicate with one another.

But although the transitional justice literature emphasizes the positive role that international pressure plays in advancing justice, the business and human rights literature identifies international constraints in the area of corporate abuses. These include the lack of settled law establishing businesses' human rights responsibilities, the absence of courts to adjudicate corporate human rights violation cases, and the international focus on voluntary principles over legal obligations. Despite this unpropitious international climate, civil society mobilization and judicial innovation have advanced accountability efforts and overcome the strong veto power of business in some countries, often creatively blending international and domestic law. These efforts from below provide access to justice for victims and potential models for overcoming the current accountability gap.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-085100,Oct-16,Vol. 12,63-84 ,

Here, I consider the Torrens as a system of land registry inaugurated in the colony of South Australia (1858) and as the last clipper ship to be built in Britain (1875). In its recurring and double life, the Torrens offers an illuminating nineteenth-century example of the interconnection and interdependence of land and sea that serves as a useful lesson today.

Although this reflects a response to increasing demand for these services by transnational companies, lawyers in these firms also help further the process of globalization that fuels such demand. One arena in which this occurs is the construction of transnational governance regimes that harmonize standards and expectations with respect to a variety of business activities. These regimes may be based on two different visions of the globalization process. One vision is of markets increasingly unfettered by national regulation, while another is of widely accepted human rights that impose common constraints on business activities. This article surveys the literature on transnational governance regimes and the work of transnational corporate lawyers to illuminate these dynamics, and suggests that further research on this topic can provide insight into how lawyers contribute to the globalization process.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030617,Oct-16,Vol. 12,133-152 ,

Yet as states increasingly adopt progressive reforms like scaling back the drug war, punishment in other respects continues to grow harsher. This article applies the agonistic perspective to explain these contradictory trends. I argue that the struggles of agonists in the penal field, in the context of socio-structural changes, have produced this pattern of reform. In particular, although the conservative Right on Crime movement has claimed much of the credit, recent policy shifts would not have been possible without the long struggle of progressive and moderate actors throughout the past four decades to challenge the punitive status quo. In addition, the emergent alliances between groups with contrasting political ideologies help explain both the possibilities and limitations of reform.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-085046,Oct-16,Vol. 12,153-170 ,
143,Takings as a Sociolegal Concept: An Interdisciplinary Examination of Involuntary Property Loss, Bernadette Atuahene,"This review seeks to establish takings as a respected field of sociolegal inquiry. In the legal academy, the term takings has become synonymous with constitutional takings. When defined more broadly, however, a taking is when a person, entity, or state confiscates, destroys, or diminishes rights to property without the informed consent of rights holders. Adopting a more expansive conception of takings lays the groundwork for a robust interdisciplinary conversation about the diverse manifestations and impacts of involuntary property loss, where some of the most valuable contributions are made by people who do not consider themselves property scholars. This review starts the conversation by bringing together the empirical literature on takings published between 2000 and 2015 and scattered in the fields of law, economics, political science, sociology, psychology, geography, and anthropology. Most importantly, a robust understanding of property's multiple values is required to fully comprehend the magnitude of the loss associated with takings, and this creates a space in which scholars can rescue property's political, cultural, emotional, and social value from the sizeable shadow cast by the overly dominant focus on its economic value.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-084457,Oct-16,Vol. 12,171-197 ,

Its main premise is that the market is morally and practically superior to government and any form of political control intended to improve on market outcomes. Central and Eastern European countries (CEEs) were global leaders in the adoption of neoliberal ideas and policies during the 1990s and 2000s. Almost all CEEs adopted neoliberal ideas and policies at a dramatic rate and are now among the most open economies in Europe. This was particularly true during the early transition period, when neoliberalism emerged as a virtually unchallenged ideology strongly dominating the course of economic and political reforms in the region. CEEs largely followed the script written by the authors of the Washington consensus and implemented monetary stabilization, economic liberalization, and a grand-scale privatization of the largely state-owned economy.

Sorcery and witchcraft are also (once again) becoming a challenge for countries in the global North, mainly within migrant communities in relation to children accused of witchcraft and exorcized and also in the context of claims to refugee status and freedom of religion. The article covers scholarly literature (legal, anthropological, economic, historical), law reform commission reports, nongovernmental organization (NGO) reports, and UN documents over the past 15 years concerning the regulation of the negative societal impacts of sorcery and witchcraft practices and beliefs. It concludes that there is a need for greater empirical study of the impacts of various regulatory initiatives adopted and promoted by national governments, NGOs, and international organizations.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-084600,Oct-16,Vol. 12,331-351 ,
151,Impact of Judicial Elections on Judicial Decisions, Herbert M. Kritzer,"Does the process of judicial selection and retention affect the decisions made by judges? Focusing on retention rather than initial selection, this article examines whether the method of retention directly or indirectly affects decisions. Extant literature shows clear effects related to criminal cases, particularly cases involving the death penalty, but also in criminal sentencing in trial courts. At the trial court level, there are also indications of election cycle effects. At the Supreme Court level, there is also some indication of effects in abortion-related cases and in cases involving government parties. This article also looks at the impact of two process-related features of judicial elections: advertising and campaign contributions. There is little research on the advertising question but substantial research on campaign contributions. That latter literature has struggled to overcome the problem of distinguishing friendly giving from actual effects on decisions; although there are growing indications that there may be some contribution effects in some situations, the research is far from definitive.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-084812,Oct-16,Vol. 12,353-371 ,
152,Overlooked and Undervalued: Women in Private Law Practice, Joyce S. Sterling and  Nancy Reichman,This article examines the durability of gender inequality in private law practice since Kay & Gorman published their comprehensive review in the Annual Review of Law and Social Science in 2008. We begin with some of the changes in legal practice that intensified during the Great Recession and help to contextualize women's lack of progress. We turn next to a contemporary profile of women in private practice that demonstrates empirically where women stand. We look at some of the organizational mechanisms that seem to perpetuate inequality. The challenges of integrating work and family dominated the discussion of women's lack of progress in earlier reviews of women in the legal profession and continue to matter greatly. We assume the persistence of these challenges and instead focus on ways that the mechanisms or strategies for determining compensation systematically overlook and undervalue women's contributions. We consider the different social science frameworks that explain women as overlooked and undervalued for their contributions. We conclude with proposed suggestions for changes aimed at remedying the problems discussed here.,Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121705,Oct-16,Vol. 12,373-393 ,
153,Legal Discrimination: Empirical Sociolegal and Critical Race Perspectives on Antidiscrimination Law," Lauren B. Edelman,*  Aaron C. Smyth, and  Asad Rahim","The topic of workplace discrimination has received considerable attention in both empirical sociolegal scholarship and critical race theory. This article reviews the insights of both bodies of literature and draws on those insights to highlight a critical mismatch between the assumptions of antidiscrimination jurisprudence and extant knowledge about discrimination in the workplace. Antidiscrimination jurisprudence assumes that most discrimination is intentional, that legal rights provide an effective mechanism for redress of discrimination, and that employers respond rationally to legal sanctions. In contrast, the empirical sociolegal and critical race literatures show that racism and sexism tend to be hidden within social structures, that there are many obstacles to the successful mobilization of legal rights, and that organizational response to law is characterized by symbolic compliance that is often ineffective. We conclude that because law fails to grasp the reality of workplace discrimination, it condones racial and gender inequality and creates legal discrimination.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-085234,Oct-16,Vol. 12,395-415 ,
154,Legal Socialization: Coercion versus Consent in an Era of Mistrust, Rick Trinkner and  Tom R. Tyler,"Legal socialization is the process whereby people develop their relationship with the law via the acquisition of law-related values, attitudes, and reasoning capacities. Research on legal socialization distinguishes between two different orientations toward the law: coercive and consensual. Coercive orientations are rooted in the use of force and punishment, ultimately leading to an instrumentally focused relationship built on dominance. Consensual orientations are rooted in the acquisition of values encompassing concerns over treatment, decision making, and boundaries. When authorities embody these values, they promote trust and legitimacy and foster a relationship built on shared values and the voluntary acceptance of legal authority. Despite these findings, the appropriateness of a consensual over a coercive approach is heavily contested across legal and nonlegal contexts. However, research consistently demonstrates that socializing supportive values and encouraging favorable attitudes not only motivates compliance with the law but promotes voluntary deference and willing cooperation with legal authorities.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-085141,Oct-16,Vol. 12,417-439 ,
155,Corporate Lawyers in Emerging Markets, Bryant G. Garth,"The growth of corporate law firms in emerging markets is mainly followed by practitioner journals reporting new offices and mergers, the openness of markets to non-national lawyers, and various rankings of local and transnational law firms. There is a small but growing academic literature that, for the most part, relies on US theoretical models, asking whether the corporate law firms are converging toward a global standard or what form of global/local hybrid is taking root. This literature fits well with the practical concerns about the specific spread of corporate lawyers. A complementary approach looks more into the global processes that produce the expectation that corporate lawyers will evolve into some modern model resembling the US corporate lawyer. For this more general line of research the position of corporate lawyers in relation to the state becomes more important, as do the hierarchical and imperial relationships that are manifested in different roles and statuses for those from the core and those from the periphery.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-084627,Oct-16,Vol. 12,441-457 ,
156,The Firm As a Nexus of Organizational Theories: Sociological Perspectives on the Modern Law Firm, Alan James Kluegel,"A law firm is an organization staffed, owned, and managed by professionals; as such, law firms sit at the nexus of two distinct strands of academic inquiry: work on the professions and work on organizations. Law firms are governed by distinct rules, perform specialized work, and must integrate professional norms with organizational goals—and thus they present a unique challenge to researchers. This article reviews the organizational literature examining the structure and behavior of corporate law firms, connects this work to the sociological literature on the legal profession, and suggests new ways to combine these approaches and thereby deepen our understanding of the law firm as a unique organizational form.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-085217,Oct-16,Vol. 12,459-478 ,

158,An Unusual Career: Considering Political/Legal Orders and Unofficial Parallel Realities,Sally Falk Moore,"Sally Moore was initially a lawyer and later became an anthropologist. In this article she reflects on three major projects in her professional history: preparations for the second set of Nuremberg Trials, a dissertation on law in Inca Peru, and fieldwork in a time of postcolonial socialism on Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa. All three situations presented strong official versions of law and its supposedly controlling effect on the social order. Contact showed that in each instance there were important unofficial counter-ideas and activities imbedded in the events of the time. The conclusion from this is that in approaching the study of any legal order, one must presume that there is concurrently a considerable, active unofficial reality and that it has its own effects and momentum and should be addressed.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121449,Nov-15,Vol. 11,1-14,

In recent years, however, interest in housing has waned, leaving many questions fundamental to the poverty debate unanswered. This article calls for a renewed focus on housing, law, and poverty, with particular attention to the housing sector where most low-income families live, unassisted: the private rental market. Surveying social-scientific research, legal analysis, and case history on affordability, access, housing conditions, forced displacement, and homelessness, this article shows how housing plays a central, crucial role in the lives of poor Americans. The poor have been central to the development of housing law, and the law itself has done much to mitigate and aggravate their poverty.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121623,Nov-15,Vol. 11,15-35 ,

Boccaccini,"Can experts remain objective and accurate when one particular side in adversarial legal proceedings retains them? Despite long-standing concerns from the legal system and the general public, research has only recently explored whether experts can provide opinions unbiased by the side that retained them. This review addresses some of the factors that may cause disagreements between opposing experts. After summarizing recent field and experimental studies on mental health evaluations by forensic experts, we conclude that working for one side in an adversarial case causes some experts' opinions to drift toward the party retaining their services, even on ostensibly objective instruments and procedures. We call this process adversarial allegiance. The mechanisms that underlie adversarial allegiance among forensic experts are likely similar to the unconscious heuristics and cognitive biases that compromise judgment in a variety of other settings, but these will require further study to understand, and ultimately reduce, adversarial allegiance.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121714,Nov-15,Vol. 11,37-55 ,

Robbennolt,"Research on behavioral ethics is flourishing, providing new insight into the cognitive, situational, and social factors that influence ethical decisions. Although many common approaches to dealing with legal ethics assume that unethical behavior is a result of conscious decision making driven by economic self-interest, the psychology of behavioral ethics makes clear that ethical decision making is far more complex than bad actors making conscious decisions to act unethically for their own economic advancement. This article reviews recent work on behavioral ethics, bringing together research findings about cognitive and social factors that influence ethical decision making and focusing on those with particular application to the legal context. The ethical issues faced by lawyers provide a rich context within which to apply the findings of existing research and to conduct new research that explores both the unexceptional and unique structures and pressures on ethical decision making in legal practice.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121631,Nov-15,Vol. 11,75-93 ,

Although in some cases the rigidity of formal amendment rules has produced debates over the impact of judicial interpretation as a substitute for amendment, in other cases amendments remain highly controversial or existing constitutional provisions remain unimplemented owing to continuing social, economic, or political pressures. This review both explores the continuing theoretical debates over the idea of constitutional amendment and uses the examples of historic land conflicts in South Africa and Zimbabwe to demonstrate the interaction between existing constitutional provisions, formal amendments, and ongoing demands over land and property rights. By providing both an overview of the theoretical debates as well as a contextual application, this review aims to demonstrate the importance of a contextually grounded, sociolegal understanding of the phenomena of constitutional amendment, stasis, and change.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121523,Nov-15,Vol. 11,95-110 ,

Although it often dominates the policy focus, questions have been raised about its effectiveness and social costs, as well as how it compares to alternative surveillance measures. A theoretical and programmatic understanding of surveillance draws attention to other widely used surveillance measures that perform a crime prevention function in public places. These include improved street lighting, security guards, place managers (e.g., bus drivers and parking lot attendants), and defensible space (i.e., changes to the built environment). This article reviews the research evidence on the effectiveness of the full range of public area surveillance measures and examines related social costs. It also serves to broaden the view of public area surveillance beyond the current narrow focus on CCTV.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121649,Nov-15,Vol. 11,111-130 ,

A key reason for this, we argue, is the absence of positive theories of praxis that can instantiate essentially contested concepts such as rule of law. We discuss the emergence of one nascent alternative, the World Bank's Justice for the Poor program, locating it within broader turns to experimental approaches to development. In doing so, we argue that rule of law reform must be understood in the context of the politics of the relationship between development experts and the domestic political forums in and through which rules systems emerge. As such, a primary task of external agencies is to help forge and sustain such forums, to recognize the deep imbrication between the process norms of these forums and the nature of the rule of law being produced, and to ensure that the empirical foundations on which ensuing deliberations rest are both sound and accessible. We conclude with an exploration of the challenges of this approach, from methodological challenges in building an empirical foundation to political accountability concerns with respect to rule of law reformers themselves.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121550,Nov-15,Vol. 11,155-174 ,

Whereas Big Brother and civil liberties narratives dominate the academic discussion of opposition in this area, we focus on reviewing evidence of the more routine adaptations that characterize many people's response to attempts to change their behavior. Discussion of some frequently encountered technologies (including closed-circuit television and speed cameras) is situated within a reflection on the changes in conceptualizations of both crime and the criminal observable over recent decades. Many acts of resistance within this context can, it is proposed, be understood not as examples of ideological opposition but as rational and predominantly self-interested responses to these new conditions.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121639,Nov-15,Vol. 11,175-192 ,

In this essay we outline two major challenges and several fruitful directions forward. First, we review the different outcomes of interest in research on labor rights and highlight several tensions that lead to difficulty comparing findings across studies, inappropriate data choices, and unexamined causal assumptions. Second, we highlight a failure to adequately integrate the findings of research in two different subliteratures, one focusing on the incentives of states and firms to adopt reforms, and a second focusing on the implementation of those reforms with monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. We conclude by highlighting the important questions raised by a clearer integration of these two literatures and identifying several recent studies that begin to answer them.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121322,Nov-15,Vol. 11,193-209 ,

More recently, interest in the topic has been fueled by the need to develop evidence-based methods that improve the collection of diagnostic confession evidence and accurate intelligence from human sources. In this review, we update the research on false confessions and describe recent assessments of scientifically validated approaches for obtaining cooperation, eliciting confessions, and detecting deceit. Studies are summarized through the prism of accusatorial versus information-gathering approaches to interrogation: The former rely on psychological manipulation and control-based methods, whereas the latter focus on developing rapport and cooperation to elicit an account that can be strategically addressed via evidence presentation. The review concludes with recommendations for additional research to further improve the effectiveness of interrogations across a variety of contexts.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-120814-121657,Nov-15,Vol. 11,211-233 ,

The first centers on the practices of legal control, and the second focuses attention on the effects of these practices on their potential targets.

172,"Race, Ethnicity, and Culture in Jury Decision Making", Jennifer S. Hunt,"This article reviews a growing body of social science research indicating that race, ethnicity, and culture can influence the judgments and behaviors of juries. The first section addresses research on jury bias, which shows that jurors often make harsher judgments of defendants from other racial and ethnic groups and are more likely to give death sentences in cases involving Black or Latino defendants and White victims. However, these effects are moderated by several factors related to the trial parties, context, and crime. Further, juror bias often involves subtle or implicit psychological processes that can be difficult to recognize and correct. The second section discusses research conceptualizing jurors as agentic forces whose judgments and behaviors may reflect their racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. This work shows that jurors' backgrounds may influence their reactions to defendants, trial judgments, and deliberation behaviors.

173,Social Rights Constitutionalism: Negotiating the Tension Between the Universal and the Particular," Daniel M. Brinks,*  Varun Gauri, and  Kyle Shen","The increasing importance of social rights language in constitutional texts and in the politics of social provision and human security has triggered a voluminous academic literature. Despite its global origins, we argue, social rights language goes through a process of vernacularization, through which it transforms and is transformed by local politics. The process begins when particular rights are included in constitutional texts and continues when local groups take hold of that language to express their particular aspirations. The struggle to realize social rights is a political one, grounded in and pursued through local structures of demand. In the course of that struggle, rights acquire local particularities. At the same time, the global origins and universal language of rights can open possibilities for subordinate groups to challenge the status quo. Whether or not social rights constitutionalism in the end improves the situation for these groups or simply reinforces the status quo depends on the outcome of this vernacularization process, rather than on any a priori features of social rights language or social constitutionalism.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030654,Nov-15,Vol. 11,289-308 ,

This article situates the new literature within the longer tradition of postcolonial South Asian legal studies, focusing on work written by lawyers and historians. The first wave of South Asian legal studies emerged in what historians would call the long 1960s from a group of American lawyers and social scientists working on the legal profession and the experience of dispute resolution in India. The second wave, which has concentrated on the themes of gender and religion in British India, has been shaped by different influences, namely developments in the Indian women's movement and in Indian legal education during the 1980s and 1990s. The survey considers whether the new scholarship is overly focused on elites, the state, the colonial period, and English-language sources. It also identifies regional crosscutting themes that have generated research on South Asia beyond India, particularly constitutionalism, states of emergency, and the legal profession; Buddhist legal studies; gender; and rule-of-law development efforts.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-134041,Nov-15,Vol. 11,309-336 ,

Additionally, various authors over the years have examined gender, religion, and caste—each on its own, but also how each can intersect with one another and with the other above-mentioned topics. And more recently, there has been a burgeoning sociolegal literature on the role globalization plays in India. Scholars who have written on these issues approach their work from a range of methodological perspectives, but regardless, as we argue here, much of this literature has served as a vehicle to champion the rights of the needy. Gaps, of course, still are present, which we discuss.

This framework has been applied to many procedural issues, and this survey focuses on three: dispositive motions (motions to dismiss and summary judgment), discovery, and jurisdiction. Economic analysis has yielded significant insights in these areas, but important questions remain for future researchers.

Weidemaier and  Mitu Gulati,"The literature on sovereign debt treats law as of marginal significance, largely because the doctrine of sovereign immunity leaves creditors few potent legal remedies against sovereign borrowers. Although sovereign debts can indeed be hard to enforce, the goal of this article is to demonstrate that law plays a central, and constantly evolving, role in structuring sovereign debt markets. To list just a few examples, legal rules and institutions (a) decide when a borrower is sovereign, (b) define the consequences of sovereignty by drawing (or refusing to draw) artificial boundaries between the sovereign and other legal entities, (c) play some role in cases of state and government succession, and (d) determine the extent to which the rules of sovereign immunity can be changed by contract.

Research on regulation within an interdisciplinary structure, the Regulatory Institutions Network, is used to illustrate the difficulties of attempts to change direction in the social sciences. The article advocates the creative destruction of disciplinary structures by organizing in tents that study institutionalization (rather than buildings that study categories of institutions). To keep pace with social change, pulling tents down and endlessly pegging out new ones is a path forward. A politics of defending universities and opposing the disciplines that have captured them does not mean advocacy of restructuring.

180,Legal Education in the Corporate University, Margaret Thornton,"State disinvestment in higher education has been a notable characteristic of neoliberalism all over the world, and the corporatization of universities has been the typical response. It has led to a proliferation of law schools with students paying high fees. Corporatization has also engendered a culture of relentless competition between universities, which manifests itself in league tables and rankings. The pursuit of prestige has compelled law schools to prioritize research over teaching, which poses a dilemma for what is taught and how it is taught. The contradictions of the corporatization thesis are graphically illustrated by the experiences of Australia, which might be described as the canary in the mine shaft. Although corporatization plays out differently in decentralized regimes with a substantial private sector, such as the United States, its impact on the legal academy in those places has been similarly profound. It is apparent that the dilemmas posed by corporatization for the legal academy require considered scholarly attention.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030714,Nov-14,Vol. 10,19-35 ,
181,Legal Indicators: The Power of Quantitative Measures of Law, Kevin E. Davis,"Legal indicators, sometimes known as rule of law indicators, governance indicators, or indicators of public service performance, are quantitative measures of the performance of legal systems. They are used both as sources of knowledge about societies and as means of governing them (technologies of governance). As a result, these indicators have begun to attract considerable attention from scholars, policy makers, and other actors. Key issues include the following: When, why, and by whom are various kinds of legal indicators produced? Are they reliable and valid? How influential are they? Given their influence, should they be regulated, and if so, how? This article reviews recent efforts to answer these questions. The overarching theme is that all of these questions are related to one another.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030857,Nov-14,Vol. 10,37-52 ,
182,Field Experimentation and the Study of Law and Policy, Donald P. Green and  Dane R. Thorley,"Field experiments are randomized experiments that take place under naturalistic conditions. This research method is experiencing rapid growth throughout the social sciences and especially in legal studies, where it is used to rigorously evaluate policies and programs. We begin by charting the growth of field experimentation in law and legal studies, describing the statistical properties of experiments and discussing the practical threats that may undermine experiments conducted in field settings. Next, we review the experimental research literature in a variety of domains: legal institutions, including the judiciary, legislature, and legal profession; incentives, especially as they apply to tax compliance and business law; and laws and obligations, including legal code, policy, and legal theory. We conclude by highlighting some of the challenges that the experimental literature must confront if it is to speak convincingly to issues of law and policy.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030936,Nov-14,Vol. 10,53-72 ,
183,Interviewing Children, Thomas D Lyon,"This article reviews best practice for interviewing child witnesses. In most officially recognized abuse cases, the child previously disclosed abuse, making it possible to elicit disclosures without asking closed-ended questions. Interviewers nevertheless overuse closed-ended questions, which lead to short unelaborated responses, privilege the limited perspective of the interviewer, maximize the potential for linguistic difficulties, increase children's tendency to guess, and risk response biases. Interviewers can avoid closed-ended questions through narrative practice, in which interviewers ask children to narrate a recent innocuous event before introducing the abuse topic; cued invitations, in which interviewers repeat details reported by children and ask for elaboration; open-ended wh- questions; and interview instructions, including asking children to promise to tell the truth. A remaining challenge is how to elicit disclosures from reluctant children. Better understanding of the dynamics of abuse disclosure and optimal interviewing strategies can assist the legal system in assessing the veracity of children's reports.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030913,Nov-14,Vol. 10,73-89 ,
184,Law and Society in Brazil at the Crossroads: A Review, José Reinaldo de Lima Lopes and  Roberto Freitas Filho,"This article presents a general overview of Brazilian sociolegal studies. After presenting a short historical narrative of the field in Brazil, we argue that the early years of intense teaching of legal sociology had a politically committed approach, which gave rise to growing criticism of Brazilian legal scholarship that in turn affected the self-image of law professors. Different theoretical strands appeared in the years that followed, and some specific fields of research gained importance, particularly those concerning a sociology of the legal profession, the administration of courts, and law schools. However, we contend that as time went by, many sociolegal scholars began to neglect the critical approach to law, and today most of them fail to confront critical aspects of the gap between law on the books and law in action, especially when that gap affects lower classes or stigmatized populations.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030625,Nov-14,Vol. 10,91-103 ,
185,The Dispute Tree and the Legal Forest," Catherine R. Albiston,  Lauren B. Edelman, and  Joy Milligan","Since the Civil Litigation Research Project in the 1980s, sociolegal researchers have referenced the metaphor of the dispute pyramid to understand dispute resolution. The pyramid focuses on formal legal dispute resolution and represents disputes as a linear process of attrition in which only a small proportion of perceived injuries proceed to adjudication. Although a fertile metaphor, the dispute pyramid approach left important processes undertheorized and understudied. We propose a new metaphor: the dispute tree. The dispute tree has many branches, both legal and nonlegal, through which grievances may be resolved. Grievances may move along several branches simultaneously, and dispute resolution may be a nonlinear process. Branches represent the evolving nature of disputes as living organisms that may bear flowers and fruit or may wither and die. Not only dispute trees but also their forests are subjects for study. Dispute trees exist in social environments that may foster or inhibit healthy growth; they may grow within public or privately governed forests. We argue that the dispute tree metaphor better represents decades of research on disputing, which has identified myriad disputing channels outside of courts, as well as both individual and collective mobilization. We also believe that this new metaphor for disputes and the dispute process will open new avenues of inquiry.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030826,Nov-14,Vol. 10,105-131 ,
186,Disentangling Law: The Practice of Bracketing, Nicholas Blomley,"Following the call to focus on law as a set of practices, I develop Michel Callon's concept of framing (which I refer to here as bracketing) in relation to law. Bracketing is the process of delimiting a sphere within which interactions take place more or less independently of a surrounding context. It temporarily rearranges the relations that constitute legal reality. A legal contract, for example, draws certain objects and relationships into sharper focus, ignoring or deliberately excluding others. I offer several examples of legal bracketing—some foundational, others highly routinized—and note several distinctive characteristics. I then use bracketing to think about legal categorization, law as effect (rather than essence), law's success, and the heterogeneity found within a legal frame.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030719,Nov-14,Vol. 10,133-148 ,
187,Critical Race Theory Meets Social Science, Devon W. Carbado and  Daria Roithmayr,"Social science research offers critical race theory (CRT) scholars a useful methodology to advance core CRT claims. Among other things, social science can provide CRT with data and theoretical frameworks to support key empirical claims. Social psychology and sociology in particular can help to explain how race constructs key aspects of social experience—for example, the role of race in suspicion of African Americans as potentially criminal and the use of excessive force by law enforcement. At the same time, a collaboration between CRT and social science risks undermining CRT critiques of objectivity and neutrality and potentially limits the theory's ability to combat structural forms of racial inequality. CRT scholars can mitigate these risks by choosing social science methods carefully and by recognizing that social science is only one among several modes of knowledge production.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030928,Nov-14,Vol. 10,149-167 ,
188,Language-and-Law Scholarship: An Interdisciplinary Conversation and a Post-9/11 Example, Elizabeth Mertz and  Jothie Rajah,"Language-and-law research is now an established field for study, with decades of development behind it. And yet the field remains fragmented, with disparate streams of scholarship that, ironically, tend to speak in different languages: linguistic anthropology, discourse studies, semiotics, literary theory and rhetoric, translation studies, sociolinguistics, legal philosophy, and more. On one hand, this broad variety speaks to the robust character of language-and-law studies as a focus for relatively diverse scholarly endeavors. And for a number of reasons, it seems likely that the separate schools of thought in this area will generally continue to pursue their often distinct paths. On the other hand, as this article argues, a careful reading of work in the area reveals the potential for a productive conversation among some very different perspectives. Such a conversation offers the promise of creating exciting bridges among law, the social sciences, and the humanities. It also draws together interest in a variety of kinds of language: spoken, gestural, written, visual. This kind of bridge, we suggest, is one of the gifts of the truly interdisciplinary space opened up by sociolegal research—it permits us to combine quite diverse kinds of knowledge in our quest to more fully understand closely related legal phenomena. In this article, we also combine two different kinds of disciplinary voices, inviting the reader to assess what insights about law arise from these voices separately and, perhaps, together.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-133958,Nov-14,Vol. 10,169-183 ,

It is variously employed in normative and descriptive ways; in absolute and relative terms; as a theoretical construct and a practical safeguard; in regard to judges individually and collectively; as an end in itself and a means to other ends; as a matter of hard law and soft norm; and in relation to the political branches of government, the media, the electorate, litigants, interest groups, and judges themselves.

190,The Legitimacy of the US Supreme Court: Conventional Wisdoms and Recent Challenges Thereto, James L. Gibson and  Michael J. Nelson,"Research on the legitimacy of the US Supreme Court has blossomed of late, with scholars investigating many different hypotheses derived from legitimacy theory. As the theory has been pushed, a number of new controversies have emerged. Here, we identify four such debates: (a) whether the Court's legitimacy rests on satisfaction with its performance, (b) whether support for the Supreme Court reflects the polarization of politics in the contemporary United States, (c) whether the Court's legitimacy requires belief in the “myth of legality”, and (d) whether judicial decisions can change public opinion. Our analysis of these issues generally concludes that the Supreme Court's legitimacy is reasonably secure, in part because individual rulings have little impact on support for the institution, in part because the Court has access to powerful and influential symbols of judicial authority, and in part because the current Supreme Court issues roughly equal numbers of conservative and liberal decisions.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030546,Nov-14,Vol. 10,201-219 ,

But meaningful progress and research are still held back by a number of debates between academics, policy makers, and activists. Agreeing upon a consistent definition and methods of measuring trafficking presents a challenge, as does the continued focus on the sex trafficking of women into prostitution to the exclusion of other types of trafficking and genders. Debates over what type of crime trafficking is and what drives it (organized crime, human rights, migration policies) have also had important impacts on the way that the phenomenon is conceptualized and dealt with at the national and international levels. This article outlines these debates and suggests directions for future research that can reveal the complexities of the phenomenon but also clarify our understandings of the lived experiences of people involved and the processes that drive it.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030952,Nov-14,Vol. 10,221-242 ,
192,Public Disorders: Theory and Practice, Sophie Body-Gendrot,"Public disorder, interpreted as a nuisance by some, is a sign of democratic vitality and innovation for others. Depending on context, it takes many forms. Hooligans, gangs, rioters, and radical groups engage in violent rituals. A breakdown of order allows opportunistic action. Failed negotiations or broken organized social processes, themselves devoid of violence, may lead to coordinated destruction or scattered attacks. Police are an essential piece in the dramaturgy of disorder, and their responses reflect what they have been trained to do and what is institutionally sanctioned. Theories of public disorder and related hypotheses address causes (the relative deprivation theory, the broken windows hypothesis) and dynamics (mobilization of resources, the spark and tinder metaphor, the flashpoint model). The interactionist/comprehensive perspective is also relevant, as it examines how routine relations may be modified by the operation of multiple forces that, in the course of fluid and undetermined situations, come together to produce public disorder in a modified context. In sum, public disorders can make a difference and cause lasting changes; some of them, as signs of democratic vitality, benefit the environments where they occur.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030818,Nov-14,Vol. 10,243-258 ,

In this article, we first describe the social and cultural practices that constitute cause lawyering. Second, we link cause lawyering to the clients served—from sophisticated social movement organizations to ordinary people. We show that cause lawyering is powerfully shaped by the clients served and by the contexts in which that lawyer–client relationship is situated. Finally, we examine the political context of cause lawyering. We also address larger questions in this research tradition: Is cause lawyering different from other forms of lawyering? How and why does cause lawyering produce tension between the lawyers and their clients?

In subsequent years, research on SLBs provided significant insight into the interactions of SLBs and citizens. In particular, scholarship has focused on the inherently autonomous nature of street-level work and the discretion these agents of the state possess. Work in this area has traditionally relied on teachers, social workers, and police officers as sources for empirical study of how formal and informal social structures influence the use of discretion by SLBs. Recent scholarship, and coverage of New York City's stop and frisk policy, has renewed interest in the role that SLBs play in constructing justice for the citizens they encounter. In this review, we consider the street-level-bureaucracy scholarship and articulate how insights from this literature inform our current understanding of investigatory police stops, such as those stemming from the stop and frisk policy in place in New York.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-134046,Nov-14,Vol. 10,321-334 ,

Today, policing agencies use stop and frisk prophylactically, stopping in some cities tens or even hundreds of thousands of people annually. These developments and the litigation around the strategy in New York City and elsewhere provide an opportunity to revisit Terry and to consider recent research in law and social science regarding stop and frisk. This review focuses on three issues: the evolution of legal doctrine pertaining to stop and frisk, arguments regarding the effectiveness of stop and frisk as a mechanism to control and reduce crime, and a delineation of the relevance of the theory of procedural justice to our understanding of the interleaving of the law and social science of stop and frisk.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-134043,Nov-14,Vol. 10,335-352 ,

It addresses the twin processes of the externalization (outsourcing) and internalization (insourcing) of border controls, both of which rest on the securitization of migration management. Outsourcing involves a series of extraterritorial activities in sending and in transit countries at the request of the more powerful receiving state. Insourcing includes the policing of immigrants and enforcement controls within the interior, such as the detection, detention, and deportation of immigrants. This multipronged strategy that extends beyond the edges of a territory highlights the spaciality of enforcement and the buttressing of power imbalances between sending countries, on one hand, and transit and receiving countries, on the other, as well as inequalities within national territories with respect to legal status.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030842,Nov-14,Vol. 10,353-369 ,

It may interest scholars who seek to understand the history of the field's revival, and those who were among the first generation of Law and Society Association members may see some of their own experience in Lempert's account. The article then discusses policy uses of law and social science research and cautions against the possibility that a study's policy appeal may exceed the weight that can fairly be put on it. Five studies are used as examples: Wilson and Kelling's essay on “broken windows,” Sherman and Berk's work on arrest for spouse abuse, Ehrlich's article on the deterrent effects of the death penalty, Lott and Mustard's work on right-to-carry laws, and Sander's mismatch critique of affirmative action.

200,Integrating Law and Health Policy, Sandra R. Levitsky,"This review considers what can be learned from bridging sociolegal scholarship with contemporary research on health policy. Public health scholars have relied on a narrow understanding of the role law can play in health care reform, viewing law as a set of commands from above that direct the behavior of individuals. Incorporating a cultural perspective of law would allow public health scholars to observe law's effects in a much wider range of contexts. Meanwhile, the cultural turn in sociolegal studies toward an emphasis on law's role in the construction of everyday life has resulted in a shift away from the study of state policy altogether. As a consequence, the microlevel analyses that have come to dominate sociolegal scholarship are rarely connected to the macrolevel politics that shape them. Issues relating to health care offer sociolegal researchers an opportunity to reestablish a connection with social policy and extend their understanding of the power and meaning of law.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-133949,Nov-13,Vol. 9,33-50 ,

202,The Political Psychology of Counterterrorism, Aziz Z.

At the same time, political and social psychologists have tested a diverse range of theories concerning how perceptions of terrorism risk affect individual and aggregate behaviors such as electoral choices and preferences over public policies. The legal scholarship, with a handful of exceptions, does not draw on this empirical literature about the “demand” for counterterrorism. In consequence, its descriptive and normative claims tend to lack warrant in any defensible account of the political psychology of counterterrorism. To begin remedying that gap, this review explores insights from the empirical literature on the psychology of individual and collective responses to terrorism in order to better comprehend the political motivations that underwrite counterterrorism policy choices. Three lines of inquiry are highlighted: how individuals perceive and process terrorism risk information, how political and policy preferences change after terrorism attacks, and how counterterrorism tactics can alter patterns of individual behavior.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-133951,Nov-13,Vol. 9,71-94 ,

These topical stories illustrate both law's effectiveness and its limitations as a public health tool. They also establish its popularity by the most apt of metrics—the willingness of legislators to enact it. The five examples demonstrate that public health law research can and does influence the development and refinement of legal interventions over time. Measuring the impact of laws can be difficult, but the field has the tools of theory and methods necessary to produce robust results.

It examines three drivers affecting the adoption, form, and content of transparency policies and other transparency measures in these institutions: spillover from national transparency laws and policies, growth in the reach and significance of authority exercised in and through global institutions, and criticism of global institutions by influential states and nongovernmental organizations. Twelve hypotheses are proposed about the effects, for states, nonstate actors, and global governance institutions, of transparency measures—formal policies and other steps to increase transparency—in global governance institutions. Finally, the article considers some implications of transparency measures for structures of political power and authority beyond the state and for global administrative law.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173840,Nov-13,Vol. 9,119-147 ,

This review integrates some of these insights to better understand the relationship between interest group participation in elections and changes in campaign finance law. The post–Citizens United world of law created regulatory vacuums that only certain groups tried to take advantage of. For example, little corporate money found its way into Super PACs or groups engaging in independent electoral advocacy. We argue that ascertaining interest groups' objectives of either using contributions to candidates to obtain access, on one hand, or using independent expenditures to install friendly candidates in office, on the other, is key to understanding how interest groups respond to legal developments. We also argue that although interest group participation in elections increased in 2012, the party-centric federal election system was largely resilient to increased interest group mobilizations, highlighting the difficulties with the replacement strategy.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-133930,Nov-13,Vol. 9,185-205 ,
208,Militant Democracy: The Institutional Bases of Democratic Self-Preservation, Giovanni Capoccia,"Over the past two decades, the concept of militant democracy—the use of legal restrictions on political expression and participation to curb extremist actors in democratic regimes—has again captured the attention of comparative constitutional lawyers and political scientists. In comparative constitutional law, the old neutral model of liberal democracy, according to which all political views are entitled to the same rights of expression and association, has given way to a general consensus that restrictions on basic rights designed to preserve democracy are legitimate. At the same time, legal scholars attribute the considerable cross-national variation in the formal design and use of such restrictions to the particular historical background of each country. In political science, a large body of work now examines specific militant restrictions on extremist actors. Although this scholarship consists mainly of descriptive analyses, it has begun to advance causal hypotheses explaining variation in important militant democracy policies. Taken together, these developments point to the fact that militant restrictions constitute an important facet of modern democracy and that at the same time, notwithstanding recent advances, our understanding of the phenomenon is still marked by significant gaps, making the legal and empirical analysis of militant democracy an important emerging research program both in comparative constitutional law and political science.

210,Sex Laws and Sexuality Rights in Comparative and Global Perspectives, David John Frank and  Nolan Edward Phillips,"This article seeks to explain the emergence of a new field of study oriented toward sex laws and sexuality rights in comparative and global perspectives. We argue that this field comes into focus because of three changes in the social context: the introductions of sexuality into sex, of human rights into national laws, and of global into comparative perspectives. Each turn of the social kaleidoscope generates new objects of and rationales for scholarly analysis, along with new ways and reasons to think about existing objects of analysis. Together, these contextual changes inaugurate the global study of sexuality rights and invigorate the comparative study of sex laws. Theoretical shifts accompany the empirical developments. Phenomenological approaches arise alongside their realist counterparts.

211,The Justice Cascade: The Origins and Effectiveness of Prosecutions of Human Rights Violations, Kathryn Sikkink and  Hun Joon Kim,"The justice cascade refers to a new global trend of holding political leaders criminally accountable for past human rights violations through domestic and international prosecutions. In just three decades, state leaders have gone from being immune to accountability for their human rights violations to becoming the subjects of highly publicized trials in many countries of the world. New research suggests that such trials continue to expand and often result in convictions, including some of high-level state officials. This article summarizes research on the origins of the justice cascade and its effects on human rights practices around the world. It presents evidence that such prosecutions are affecting the behavior of political leaders worldwide and have the potential to help diminish human rights violations in the future.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-133956,Nov-13,Vol. 9,269-285 ,
212,Is There a Canon of Law and Society?," Carroll Seron,  Susan Bibler Coutin, and  Pauline White Meeusen","As an interdisciplinary field, law and society has an ambivalent relationship with the notion of a canon: Being a field requires having a recognized set of key texts, even as this particular field's critique of doctrinal legal analysis creates an openness toward alternative perspectives. Within the interdisciplinary field of law and society itself, there is debate about the breadth of disciplines relevant to this domain of inquiry. To explore this tension, we analyze three sources: (a) addresses delivered by presidents of the US Law and Society Association (LSA), (b) LSA meeting calls, and (c) law and society/social science syllabi. Presidential addresses and meeting calls demonstrate how the boundaries of the field are established and contested, and course syllabi suggest a degree of consensus about key works. We conclude by discussing other national and regional research traditions and note that these critique law and society/social sciences canons for being overly United States focused or Eurocentric. We argue that such contestation underscores the health and vibrancy of law and society research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-133954,Nov-13,Vol. 9,287-306 ,

This psychological phenomenon, known as motivated cognition or motivated reasoning, has become an important topic of investigation among scholars conducting experimental research at the intersection of law and psychology.

In examining the intertwining histories of the reproductive health, reproductive rights, and reproductive justice movements, we consider the relationship between law and social movements, including the limits of law to inform radical social movements. We highlight how the relationship between scholarship and activism on the right to not have children has expanded to include notions of the right to have children (e.g., for low-income people or with the aid of technology) and the right to parent with dignity (e.g., for incarcerated people or in nonmedicalized settings).

The United States remains deeply attached to widespread use of life sentences despite mounting evidence that lengthy sentences have minimal impact on reducing the crime rate and enhancing public safety. The political and legal obstacles to seriously reconsidering the extensive use of life sentences in the United States are formidable. Moreover, some of the recent successes of penal reformers, including opponents of capital punishment and foes of the war on drugs, may have come at the cost of reinforcing the country's strong attachment to meting out life sentences and sentences of life without the possibility of parole (LWOP).",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-134014,Nov-13,Vol. 9,353-382 ,
216,Contextualizing Mass Atrocity Crimes: Moving Toward a Relational Approach, Susanne Karstedt,"Contemporary mass atrocities and genocides hold two general lessons: First, even in the course of these violent decades, genocides are rare events, and mass atrocities are not. Second, contemporary mass violence evolves in macro- and microcontexts that shape particular trajectories of conflict and violence. As the international community assumes responsibility for protecting victims and prosecuting perpetrators in contemporary high-risk environments, it is important to contextualize extreme violence and genocide and to understand the microrelational structure and dynamics of mass atrocity events. This article discusses two conceptual turns—atrocity crimes and extremely violent societies—and identifies three trajectories that move beyond an exceptionalist perspective on mass atrocities. Dynamic concentration of deterrence is suggested as a microrelational strategy for both protection and prosecution in contemporary humanitarian crises.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-134016,Nov-13,Vol. 9,383-404 ,

The focus is directed as much as possible to the extant documentation in the legal record that most affects people's lives: court decisions. For the modern period, we survey, from the point of view of the legal practitioner, lawyer, or judge, the various bodies of case law and codes in the everyday practice of the Middle East lawyer. A legal family analogous to the common or civil law traditions, Middle Eastern law has emerged as a coherent and active discipline that is increasingly a subject of inquiry for historians, social scientists, and others outside of the legal profession.

218,Legacies of Legal Realism: The Sociology of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, Jerome H. Skolnick,"In this article, I trace the history of the sociology of law from its roots at Yale Law School to the present. The legal realists, situated at Yale Law in the 1930s, saw the law as an instrument of policy. Building on this foundation, the Yale Law faculty pioneered the sociology of law in the 1950s, and the Russell Sage Foundation supported the then-emerging field's development in the 1960s. Philip Selznick was a major theorist and institution builder in the field, and my own writing has stressed how the sociology of law has challenged American ideology regarding economic, gender, and social equality. Nowhere is this more evident today than in the current racial distribution of the prison population. The legal realist vision first developed at Yale Law—of constitutional law as an instrument of social policy—was also confirmed by the most recent 2012 US Supreme Court decisions on immigration and health care.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173909,Dec-12,Vol. 8,1-10,

220,"After Critical Legal History: Scope, Scale, Structure", Christopher Tomlins,"This review outlines a course for US legal historical writing distinct from the ascendant mode of the past 30 years, generally known as critical legal history or critical historicism. Critical legal history (CLH) is premised on the conventional historical strategy of exploring the nature of an object by situating it in an appropriate context and examining the conjunction between object and context. In CLH's case, the object is law and the context is polity, economy, or society, or more usually a realm of action that is a mixture of all three. CLH is also premised on the further, theoretical, contention that whatever the realm of action in relation to which law is situated, the outcome is the same: indeterminacy marked by contingency, alternative possibilities, paths not taken. In this regard, CLH shares in the general turn in the qualitative social sciences and humanities toward complexity. The results of this contextualizing or relational approach have been empirically rich but are inevitably marked by an abandonment of authoritative causal explanation (metatheory) for thick description. This review lays out an alternative to CLH's parsing of relations between law and what is extrinsic to it, by exploring the explanatory potential of allegory, by which what are imagined as distinct become the same. Allegory is strikingly visual in conception—figurative, emblematic. John Wycliffe called it “ghostly understanding.” I explore the potential of allegory along three optical dimensions—scope (appearance), scale (perspective), and structure (constellation)—that together produce what Walter Benjamin called “the dialectical image,” a nonrelational theory of representation with striking historical applications.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173811,Dec-12,Vol. 8,31-68 ,

Judges regularly provide written explanations of their rulings, and scholars regularly argue that the true determinants of judicial decision making lie beyond the words of the judicial opinion. This review engages lines of research that take the fact of competing judicial and scholarly accounts of judicial decision making as the subject of study. In particular, this review surveys three different bodies of work that explain the enduring divide between judges and scholars in terms of motivated reasoning, judicial crisis, and the contradictory demands placed on the judicial process. These three literatures provide ways of thinking about the rule of law in the United States without dismissing the perspectives of either judges or scholars.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173852,Dec-12,Vol. 8,69-84 ,

In this article, we briefly describe the traditional approach to ethics and then present a (biased) review of the behavioral approach to ethics. We define behavioral ethics as the study of systematic and predictable ways in which individuals make ethical decisions and judge the ethical decisions of others when these decisions are at odds with intuition and the benefits of the broader society. By focusing on a descriptive rather than a normative approach to ethics, behavioral ethics is better suited than traditional approaches to addressing the increasing demand from society for a deeper understanding of what causes even good people to cross ethical boundaries.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173815,Dec-12,Vol. 8,85-104 ,

This review takes as its starting point the contradiction between the rhetoric and the reality of immigration and crime in the United States. We begin by exploring the conditions under which immigration reduces crime and those under which it has less or no effect, with particular attention to traditional and new destination sites. We then demonstrate how the moral panic about immigration has contributed to unprecedented levels of new legislation and intensified enforcement practices. These new laws and policies, we suggest, are making immigrants and their communities less safe. We consider some of the ways in which immigrants have become more vulnerable and how that vulnerability is patterned and nuanced. We close by examining recent research in other parts of the world, finding some similarities but also differences in the relationships among immigration, crime, and victimization.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173923,Dec-12,Vol. 8,141-159 ,

It utilizes insights from these disciplines to illuminate and assess the implicit and explicit assumptions about emotion that animate legal reasoning, legal doctrine, the behavior of legal actors, and the structure of legal institutions. In light of law's focus on influencing social norms and on structuring effective and just institutions, one development that holds enormous promise is the growing interdisciplinary interest in collective decision making and in the emotional dynamics of groups. Work in the affective sciences on how emotion and cognition interact is another rich vein for legal scholars interested in the assessment of responsibility and blame, the role of morality in law, and a host of other areas. Another important frontier is exploration of concrete solutions to the problems identified by law and emotion scholars.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173825,Dec-12,Vol. 8,161-181 ,

This review seeks to complement the expansion of economic reasoning and methodology within the field of environmental law and policy by identifying insights to be gleaned from various “nondismal” social sciences. In particular, three areas of inquiry are highlighted as illustrative of interdisciplinary work that might help to complement law and economics and, in some cases, compensate for it: the study of how human individuals perceive, judge, and decide; the observation and interpretation of how knowledge schemes are created, used, and regulated; and the analysis of how states and other actors coordinate through international and global regulatory regimes.

As such, schools work to implement different intervention and prevention programs. Additionally, a variety of both criminal and civil legal interventions have recently been used to prevent or punish bullying. Most US states have enacted antibullying legislation that prohibits bullying behaviors, but definitional issues that are present in the empirical research are also present in such statutes. For instance, some states focus only on physical forms of bullying or leave definitions entirely up to individual communities and schools. Bullying victims also have the option to bring civil suits for tortious acts related to the bullying; this review provides examples of the difficulties with bringing such cases.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173820,Dec-12,Vol. 8,213-230 ,

It then considers the importance of how the unrepresented feel about their experience—most particularly regarding their opportunity for “voice.” The article then explores judicial attitudes about pro se litigants, arguing that judges may be resistant to reforms to help these parties because such reforms raise fears about judicial neutrality and fair resolution of the merits.

Gould and  Scott Barclay,"Arising in the late 1960s and early 1970s—in conjunction with the development of sociology of law and the Law and Society Association—gap studies dominated much of sociolegal scholarship for a time, providing multiple examples of the ways in which law on the books is inconsistent with law in action. These gaps, in turn, spurred calls for legal reform. By the 1980s, however, gap studies came in for criticism, not only for the presumption that law was purposively rational but also for scholars' beliefs that they could identify law's aims. To some, the findings were naïve or undertheorized. Nonetheless, gap studies have illuminated many legal practices and have helped to identify pathways by which law may have an impact. Even as sociolegal scholarship has become increasingly decentered from law, one still sees the tendrils of gap studies in research exploring discrepancies between expectations and actuality in law and legality.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173833,Dec-12,Vol. 8,323-335 ,
235,Law's Archive, Renisa Mawani,"The archival turn has followed a long, protracted, and spiraled trajectory through the fields of history, historical anthropology, philosophy, and literary studies. Animated by the cultural turn and shaped by the challenges of poststructuralism, subaltern, and postcolonial studies, critics have formulated history's archive not solely as a repository of sources through which to retrieve and/or assemble the past but as an uneven effect of power and a set of contested truth claims through which history itself has been a site of struggle. Law and legal studies, by contrast, have had curiously little to say on the subject. That the archive has been the topic of such vibrant debate and disagreement outside of law but not within it is a problematic that informs this review. This article revisits the spirited and now familiar debates in history and these other fields and asks how these critical engagements—which have yet to fully dislodge the archive as truth or radically change how we write history—might productively inform conceptualizations of law's archive. Given law's significance to historical, contemporary, and future struggles over sovereignty, authority, violence, and nonviolence, its archive, I argue, cannot be broached as a compendium of sources or as a regime of power/knowledge alone. Rather, law is the archive. It is an expansive and expanding locus of juridico-political command, one that is operative through what I term a double logic of violence: a mutual and reciprocal violence of law as symbolic and material force and law as document and documentation. Law's archive is a site from which law derives its meanings, authority, and legitimacy, a proliferation of documents that obscures its originary violence and its ongoing force, and a trace that holds the potential to reveal its foundations as (il)legitimate.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173900,Dec-12,Vol. 8,337-365 ,
236,International Human Rights Law and Social Movements: States' Resistance and Civil Society's Insistence," Kiyoteru Tsutsui,  Claire Whitlinger, and  Alwyn Lim","This review examines recent scholarship on the rise of international human rights law and proposes that social movements have played critical roles both in elevating the standards of human rights in international law and in leveraging these standards into better local practices. Institutionalization of universal human rights principles began in the immediate post–World War II period, in which civil society actors worked with powerful states to establish human rights as a key guiding principle of the international community and to ensure the actors' continuing participation in international human rights institutions. The subsequent decades saw various hurdles arise in international politics, but civil society actors skillfully used the small openings that they had gained to continue to advance the cause of human rights. They held powerful governments accountable to their lofty promises about human rights and worked with sympathetic governments in the UN system to continuously upgrade the standards of international human rights. They also leveraged human rights laws toward better local practices, taking advantage of new political opportunities created by human rights laws, using expanding international channels to increase flows of human and material resources, embracing globally legitimated vocabularies of human rights to frame their movements, and integrating the broad cultural effects of human rights laws to construct new social movement identity and actorhood. The review then points out some potential pitfalls of international human rights laws: professionalization of movement actors, which can undermine the impact of social movements and lead to less ambitious and transformative goals; privileging of some causes over others, which can lead to demobilization around certain issues; and overextending movement goals, which can give rise to strong backlash against human rights principles.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173849,Dec-12,Vol. 8,367-396 ,
237,Law and Economics of Intellectual Property: In Search of First Principles, Dan L. Burk,"Economic theory has struggled to produce a coherent narrative justifying the implementation of intellectual property regimes, although a variety of rationales have been advanced as explanations. The most prevalent justification characterizes the subject matter of intellectual property in terms of public goods, which are nonrivalrously and nonexclusively consumed and thus likely to be underproduced due to free-riding problems. On this view, intellectual property regimes are intended to provide an incentive for investment in valuable intangible goods. But because the social costs of intellectual property may be significant, this explanation is not an entirely persuasive justification. Consequently, other rationales, such as incentives to disclosure, or coordination of resources, have been advanced. Given the vast variety of innovative and creative activities subject to intellectual property protection, it may be that no one explanation is adequate but rather that different rationales, or different combinations of rationales, apply in different industries.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173857,Dec-12,Vol. 8,397-414 ,

We argue that the differences in the conceptions of law, state, and society between US law and society scholarship and French historical sociology have made it hard to transfer the theory across the Atlantic. We further contend that the impact of Bourdieu's work has generally been reduced by how it has been perceived as yet another French theory. It has thus been decoupled from perhaps its greatest strength, namely, the underlying notion of sociology as a reflexive practice. Against this background, this article sets out to reconnect the practice of Bourdieusian sociology with its conceptual framework and, in so doing, demonstrate its potentially central role in the sociology of law.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173817,Dec-12,Vol. 8,433-452 ,

241,The Legislative Dismantling of a Colonial and an Apartheid State,Sally Falk Moore,"In the 1960s, social scientists speculated about what the consequence of legal, cultural, and racial pluralism would be in Africa after independence. Now, 50 years later, we know that, though transformed, cultural pluralism remains a shaping force. In Tanzania, from the 1960s on, there was an effort to build equality and national loyalty through socialism. In South Africa, after 1994, there were two major kinds of legislation that rejected the racially divisive past and attempted to repair its damage. One established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission; the other was a cluster of laws that designed a scheme of land reform. Both have been studied by anthropologists. Here, I review the Tanzanian and the two South African instances. The incompleteness and unevenness of what was achieved can be compared with the grand legislative intentions that preceded the law making. This has profound implications for the analysis of social process and for the relationships among the state, its ambitions, and its citizens.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105436,Dec-11,Vol. 7,1-16,
242,Credible Causal Inference for Empirical Legal Studies, Daniel E. Ho and  Donald B. Rubin,"We review advances toward credible causal inference that have wide application for empirical legal studies. Our chief point is simple: Research design trumps methods of analysis. We explain matching and regression discontinuity approaches in intuitive (nontechnical) terms. To illustrate, we apply these to existing data on the impact of prison facilities on inmate misconduct, which we compare to experimental evidence. What unifies modern approaches to causal inference is the prioritization of research design to create—without reference to any outcome data—subsets of comparable units. Within those subsets, outcome differences may then be plausibly attributed to exposure to the treatment rather than control condition. Traditional methods of analysis play a small role in this venture. Credible causal inference in law turns on substantive legal, not mathematical, knowledge.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105423,Dec-11,Vol. 7,17-40 ,
243,Race and Inequality in the War on Drugs, Doris Marie Provine,"Drug use is pervasive, generally private, and of long standing. The social effects are sometimes problematic, but it is a large step to declare a war on drug use. This review considers how that approach came to be adopted in the United States and why it persists despite its evident shortcomings. This war could not be maintained without societal racism and the manipulation of racial stereotypes to make drugs something to be feared. Beneath society's adherence to a failed criminalization approach is a startling indifference to its racial impact, which includes a vast increase in the number and representation of poor minorities in the prison system, particularly young African American males. Tracing the war on drugs to its roots reveals a broader domain in which harsh legislation, prosecution, and incarceration combine to harm and stigmatize minority populations, while a pervasive ideology of color blindness discourages serious discussion of inherent racial bias in the criminal justice system.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105445,Dec-11,Vol. 7,41-60 ,
244,Assessing Drug Prohibition and Its Alternatives: A Guide for Agnostics, Robert J. MacCoun and  Peter Reuter,"For decades, the debate over the merits of ending drug prohibition has carried on with little consequence. The recent near success of a cannabis legalization initiative in California suggests that citizens and politicians alike are more receptive to calls for change. We review basic research on deterrence and prices as well as emerging evidence on the potential empirical consequences of various alternatives to full prohibition, including depenalization, tolerated home cultivation, prescription regimes for cannabis and heroin, and retail sales of cannabis in Dutch coffee shops. The results are encouraging for advocates of these specific reforms, but the cases are inadequate for addressing the potentially more dramatic effects of full-scale commercial markets. The fundamental dilemma is that full legalization will probably reduce average harm per use but increase total consumption; the net effect of these two changes is difficult to project.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105442,Dec-11,Vol. 7,61-78 ,
245,The Triumph and Tragedy of Tobacco Control: A Tale of Nine Nations, Eric A. Feldman and  Ronald Bayer,"The use of law and policy to limit tobacco consumption illustrates one of the greatest triumphs of public health in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, as well as one of its most fundamental failures. Overall decreases in tobacco consumption throughout the developed world represent millions of saved lives and unquantifiable suffering averted. Yet those benefits have not been equally distributed. The poor and the undereducated have enjoyed fewer of the gains. In this review, we build on existing tobacco control scholarship and expand it both conceptually and comparatively. Our focus is the social gradient of smoking both within and across borders and how policy makers have been most effective in limiting smoking prevalence among the more privileged segments of society. To illustrate that point, we reference a range of literature on tobacco taxation, advertising, and public smoking in five economically advanced democracies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and four less developed nations—India, China, Brazil, and South Africa—that together comprise 40% of the world's population.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105427,Dec-11,Vol. 7,79-100 ,
246,Privatization and Accountability, Laura A. Dickinson,"Privatization has become a dominant feature of twenty-first century governance, creating concerns about diminished accountability and oversight. However, to properly evaluate such concerns or respond to them, we must distinguish between two different forms of accountability: accountability as after-the-fact redress and accountability as managerial oversight. Moreover, each of these forms of accountability may be pursued through a variety of mechanisms or processes, including not only criminal or civil lawsuits but also reform of the contracts that are the engine of privatization; increased public participation in the design, award, and monitoring of contracts; and changes to the organizational structure or institutional culture of contractor firms. Accordingly, this review lays out a taxonomy for analyzing privatization so that we can more comprehensively evaluate both the impact of privatization and the efficacy of possible responses. In addition, the review highlights recent privatization trends in the military and foreign aid arenas, the potential impact of such privatization on core values, and possible responses.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131542,Dec-11,Vol. 7,101-120 ,
247,"The Conundrum of Financial Regulation: Origins, Controversies, and Prospects", Laureen Snider,"This review surveys the origins and development of financial regulation as a concept and as a set of legal (state) and extralegal policies aimed at controlling financial sector activity, specifically stock market exchange. It outlines the basic tools that made financial capitalism possible, the establishment of state regulatory agencies, the cyclical nature of disaster and reform, and struggles over the viability, purposes, and sanctions regulators should pursue. I argue that recent developments, notably globalized trade and the neoliberal policies that states have pursued since the 1980s, have weakened the ability of regulators to take meaningful actions to control the antisocial acts of a financial sector that has grown, literally, too big to fail. Recent evidence indicates that the rate of technological innovations in the financial sector has outpaced the normative capacity of legal and regulatory structures. The review concludes with an examination of the solutions and remedies posed by a range of different scholars across various theoretical positions.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105412,Dec-11,Vol. 7,121-137 ,
248,Corporate and Personal Bankruptcy Law, Michelle J. White,"Bankruptcy is the legal process by which the debts of firms, individuals, and occasionally governments in financial distress are resolved. Bankruptcy law always includes three components. First, it provides a collective framework for simultaneously resolving all debts of the bankrupt entity, regardless of when they are due. Second, it provides rules for determining how the assets and earnings used to repay are divided among creditors. Third, bankruptcy law specifies punishments intended to discourage debtors from defaulting on their debts and filing for bankruptcy. This review discusses and evaluates bankruptcy law by examining whether and when the law encourages debtors and creditors to behave in economically efficient ways. It also considers how bankruptcy law might be changed to improve economic efficiency. The review shows that there are multiple economic objectives of bankruptcy law because the law has very diverse effects. Some of these objectives differ for individuals versus corporations in bankruptcy.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105401,Dec-11,Vol. 7,139-164 ,
249,Durkheim and Law: Divided Readings over Division of Labor, Carol J. Greenhouse,"Recent scholarship on Durkheim draws attention to debates implicating his ideas about law, mainly in The Division of Labor in Society, but also in Professional Ethics and Civic Morals. Division is the better known work, and established readings—otherwise diverse—find in it a thesis about law as the expression of the collective conscience and functioning to maintain community norms. Durkheim's attention to the state in Civic Morals is often read as a continuation of that thesis on law, as if the state were the culmination of collective consciousness. This article reads these works differently, highlighting the discontinuity of states and collective consciousness as the opening for Durkheim's concerns with the moral legitimacy of public authority as well as his efforts to find a subject (literally and figuratively) for the emergent discipline of sociology. The article suggests that current events offer fresh terrain for sociolegal scholars to pursue the implications of Durkheim's insights on law and states, read otherwise.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105516,Dec-11,Vol. 7,165-185 ,

The article argues that a misleading opposition between institutions and discourse is a source of that conflict, while revisiting various theoretical frameworks in an effort to overcome that opposition. Recent work on race, law, and development during the Jim Crow era is taken up with the aim of showing how we might think more capaciously about the formal and discursive properties of institutions.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-042710-092852,Dec-11,Vol. 7,187-216 ,
251,The Legal Complex, Lucien Karpik and  Terence C. Halliday,"The concept of the legal complex is a new addition to the lexicon of sociology and sociolegal scholarship. As a concept, the legal complex emerged from a series of interdisciplinary collaborations and primary research on the politics of lawyers and judges across the world. The review introduces this new collective actor to the political stage and elaborates its defining elements, morphology, varieties of mobilization, and repertoires of action. This review argues for a complementary methodological strategy for investigation of the politics of the legal complex, the longue durée and événements. With respect to political liberalism, it shows the contexts and resources in which the legal complex thrives, with particular emphasis on civil society, information technology, the rise of constitutionalism, and international circumstances. The essay argues, however, that the explanatory reach of this concept can extend to any policymaking issues, national or supranational, that involve law, legal institutions, and legal actors. By adopting the logic of analysis developed in this review, not only do previously discrete areas of work on lawyers, judges, or prosecutors come into creative tension, but a lively politics of the legal complex will refine and extend theory across the landscape of law and society research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105512,Dec-11,Vol. 7,217-236 ,
252,U.S. War and Emergency Powers: The Virtues of Constitutional Ambiguity, Gordon Silverstein,"American liberals and conservatives agree about very little concerning foreign policy, war, and emergency powers, but they do agree that the Constitution's ambiguous allocation of foreign policy powers to the legislative, executive, and judicial branches is a problem that must be fixed. For conservatives, the answer has been a reliance on constitutional reinterpretation that might establish a bright line between executive power in foreign policy and war (which they embrace) and national authority to regulate domestic and economic affairs (which they do not). For liberals, who worry that constitutional ambiguity opens the door for the abuse of executive power, the solution has been to trade formal delegation of power constrained by strict statutory limits on the exercise of that power. These efforts—liberal and conservative alike—have failed, each producing results quite the opposite of what was sought. After setting these debates in their legal, historical, and political context, this review concludes with a reexamination of the potential virtues of constitutional ambiguity.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152927,Dec-11,Vol. 7,237-267 ,

Early work in this period distinguished between legal and illegal immigration, with a focus on assimilation, ethnicity, and new ethnic enclaves in the case of the former, and an examination of the relationship between membership and movement in the case of the latter. Large-scale restructurings of the immigration enforcement regime have made the distinction between citizens and noncitizens more important than before. Thus, scholars have coined such terms as “crimmigration” to describe the unprecedented convergence of criminal and immigration law, “rescaling” to refer to shifts from national to local enforcement efforts, and “securitization” to denote the infusion of antiterrorist measures within immigration policymaking.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105525,Dec-11,Vol. 7,289-308 ,

Using Wolfe's (1994) review and critique of the vast innovation literature, we identify some of the key conceptual and theoretical issues within three separate research streams: diffusion, organizational innovativeness, and innovation process. In doing so, we suggest that police researchers should pay more attention to defining and conceptualizing innovation; to testing multiple theories explaining the spread of different innovations across police agencies; to analyzing the structural and cultural bases of diffusion; to examining and comparing the effects of individual, organizational, and environmental determinants on different innovations; and to designing systematic longitudinal studies on the entire innovation process. In addition, we examine some trends and issues related to judging innovations. Our purpose is to provide guidance that will contribute to the development of a coherent and generalizable body of research on police innovations, a field that is currently in its infancy.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152835,Dec-11,Vol. 7,309-334 ,

Empirical research, however, is decidedly mixed, with some studies finding that punishment weakens compliance, some finding that sanctions have no effect on compliance, and some finding that the effect of sanctions depends on moderating factors. In this review, we do not consider whether sanctions affect compliance but instead consider the conditions under which sanctions affect compliance. Specifically, we focus on understanding the kinds-of-people dimension of sanctions and deterrence to include individual differences (in social bonding, morality, discount rate, impulsivity, social network position, decision-making competence) and situational differences (in emotions, alcohol/drug use).

Situating individual developments into their larger context, and showing how change occurs incrementally and slowly over time, allows one to see developments in economic, human rights, and war crimes systems as part of a longer-term evolutionary process of the creation of international judicial authority. Evolution is not the same as teleology; we see that some international courts develop and change, whereas others stay in their same role and with the same low level of activity for long periods of time. The evolutionary approach of this article suggests that building judicial authority evolves through practice and takes time and that the overall international judicial context and developments in parallel institutions shape the development of individual international courts.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102510-105535,Dec-11,Vol. 7,387-415 ,

262,Specters of Foucault in Law and Society Scholarship, Mariana Valverde,"To reflect on how we, in 2010, might make the best use of the analytical tools developed by Michel Foucault, we need first to go back to the 1970s and situate his work in the intellectual history of the European left. We then see that Foucault was extremely careful to avoid developing a new model, a grand social theory that might replace the Marxism that was dominant then. Instead, he cultivated more empirically grounded, historically specific habits of thought, in a series of books that did not follow a consistent plan. In Foucault's work, the basic terms are themselves tactical weapons, and hence do not have fixed meanings. That is, the terms are not concepts. This has gone largely unnoticed in the literature: Most of the scholars who use Foucault adopt the content but use it to prop up old forms. The governmentality literature has been particularly influential in many law and society circles, and it tends to use Foucault to produce an improved sociology of modernity—rather than to question our own desire to call ourselves modern and challenge our yearning for static models. This review examines one attempt to turn Foucault into a legal philosopher, a more novel but equally problematic effort to use Foucault to renovate old disciplines. The key argument of the review is that Foucault's work is most useful when, rather than attempt to “apply” it, we use it as inspiration to ourselves to examine the preconditions and foundations of our own present's intellectual habits.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152951,Dec-10,Vol. 6,45-59 ,

Brain imaging techniques have already been used to detect brain injury, assess pain, and determine mental state and capacity for rational thought. There is also much excitement about using neuroimaging to detect lies and deception in legal and national security contexts. Despite claims of neuroimaging's revolutionary nature, numerous questions should be answered about their validity and reliability before they become widely adopted. Neuroscientists still do not fully understand the link between brain activity and behavior or memory formation. Important legal and ethical questions remain unresolved, particularly around the potential effect on juries and judges of colorful, but scientifically unproven, brain images. Finally, the very impetus behind the use of neuroscience in the legal system—to avoid the subjectivity and uncertainty of more traditional methods for assessing thought and behavior—may be misguided.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152948,Dec-10,Vol. 6,93-108 ,

The admissibility of defense-proffered testimony about phenomena such as battered woman syndrome, combat stress syndrome, or XYY syndrome depends in the first instance on how insanity, self-defense, and other defensive doctrines are defined (the materiality issue). Additionally, this type of testimony, as well as prosecution-proffered evidence about phenomena such as rape trauma syndrome and abused child syndrome, must bear indicia of reliability (the probative value issue), add to the fact finder's knowledge (the helpfulness issue), and avoid distracting or confusing the fact finder (the prejudice issue). The ultimate admissibility decision involves consideration of the scope of the criminal law, the scientific methodology associated with the syndrome, the counter-intuitiveness of the evidence, and the role and capacities of juries.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152857,Dec-10,Vol. 6,109-127 ,

Changes in the crime rates alone cannot explain this trend, and ideational accounts that focus on penal styles are problematic. Political explanations, however, show promise, given that governments must provide domestic order and candidates can use public concerns about race and street crime to win elections. This review highlights the empirical literature in sociology and also discusses some important findings in political science and economics. Law-and-order campaign appeals combined with a covert emphasis on the links between race and street crime used to overcome Republican electoral disadvantages seem to provide the most plausible explanations for the rapid increase in U.S. imprisonment rates in this racially divided society. Dissimilar political arrangements help explain why imprisonment trends in the United States have sharply departed from these trends in the affluent but less direct democracies in Western Europe.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152933,Dec-10,Vol. 6,129-149 ,

This review examines studies focusing on changes in crime, prosecution, conviction, and punishment patterns over time, as well as studies in particular settings. From these studies we conclude that crime has not always been a predominantly male phenomenon and that female crime rates have changed over time. We also conclude that, within the different categories, women defendants in particular were perceived through a gendered perspective, and their criminalization and punishment, as well as its representation in popular culture, reflected this special perspective.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152910,Dec-10,Vol. 6,151-171 ,
268,The Nexus of Domestic Violence Reform and Social Science: From Instrument of Social Change to Institutionalized Surveillance, Kristin Bumiller,"This review examines the relationship between social science research and domestic violence activism. It explores how the feminist conception of domestic violence, as formulated early in the movement, has had a resounding influence on the development of both theory and practice. The review demonstrates how social science research has often followed uncritically the path set out by anti–domestic violence activists. It provides an examination of how studies of the efficacy of legal sanctions fail to raise questions about the consequences of these interventions into private lives. The review also considers how the feminist conception of domestic violence has led to unresolved scholarly debates about the frequency and attributes of women's violence as compared to men's. In addition, it shows that the failure of feminism's explanatory framework to guide theory and practice has contributed to the triumph of a gender-neutral understanding of the problem and its reformulation as intimate partner violence. Consequently, the field has seen the growth of applied social science that has adopted a gender-neutral framework and relied upon the mechanisms of universal screening and risk management to address domestic violence. Finally, the value of ethnographic approaches are considered, particularly in regard to their potential to open the field to broader issues about social control, local culture, and inequality and their relation to the persistence of domestic violence as a social problem.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152813,Dec-10,Vol. 6,173-193 ,

In this discussion, we take both legal and cultural pluralism seriously to illustrate how laws and cultures interact to create or resist change. We consider law and culture at the international, national, and community levels. The literature shows how “insiders” who speak the language of “outsiders” can quickly lose their legitimacy at any of these levels. We also discern that the impact of law is notably more effective in the global North than in the global South although laws in all countries are typically adopted with little input from FGC-practicing communities. The greater effectiveness of laws in the North occurs because they tend to be accompanied by changes in informal social control mechanisms. In the global South, when trusted organizations work with communities to increase overall living standards as well as combat FGCs, they tend to be highly effective in reducing the practices. Ultimately, to determine the impact of international and national laws, scholars need to look at development efforts as well as anti-FGC statutes.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152822,Dec-10,Vol. 6,195-215 ,
270,The Law and Economics of Bribery and Extortion, Susan Rose-Ackerman,"Corruption has serious economic and social costs and can undermine government legitimacy. Economic analysis can help one understand the incentives for bribery and extortion and the deterrent effect of the law. Such analysis suggests that the law in many jurisdictions ought to be redesigned. Penalties are poorly tied to the marginal benefits of bribery. Small bribes often are more effectively deterred than larger ones because penalties are not tied to the perpetrators' gains. Economic analysis also highlights the tension between obtaining evidence to bring a case ex post and deterrence ex ante. Furthermore, enforcement programs have not incorporated bureaucratic structure in a sophisticated way, and in many countries the criminal law only applies to individuals, not firms. In short, economic analysis can help guide the reform debate by proposing workable law enforcement strategies for the control of bribery and extortion.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152942,Dec-10,Vol. 6,217-238 ,
271,"The Politics of Crime, Punishment, and Social Order in East Asia", David Leheny and  Sida Liu,"Recent scholarship on crime, law, and society in China and Japan has addressed the politics of globalization and legal reform in both countries, but political context is not self-revealing. The literature on China has focused too often on the role of the police in an authoritarian state without sufficiently taking into account the changing balance of power among judicial actors, which may be more important for understanding the shape and direction of Chinese legal reform. In contrast, the literature in Japan has recently begun to grapple with the new politicization of criminal justice but could do more to show how these concerns are intimately connected to deeper unease about the country's future. In suggesting new ways of analyzing the politics of criminal justice in China and Japan, this article also argues for increased attention to the social consequences of crime's increasing political saliency, including patterns of marginalization and constructions of deviancy.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152957,Dec-10,Vol. 6,239-258 ,
272,Human Rights and Policing: Exigency or Incongruence?, Julia Hornberger,"The juncture of human rights and policing is a relatively recent field of scholarship. It tends to explain the relationship between policing and human rights as one of exigency and necessity, culminating in the idea of police as human rights defenders. An ethnographically rich scholarship on policing has emerged both as a critical response to these assumptions and out of an awareness of the impossible but nevertheless central role that policing has come to play in a neoliberal age. This critical scholarship takes the juncture of policing and human rights as a historically specific phenomenon and enables us to understand many of its contingencies. It reintegrates the normative presuppositions of human rights policing as societal facts among other societal facts and points to how human rights and policing enable and foreclose new ways of ordering society and bring about particular articulations of biopolitics with assertions of sovereignty.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152830,Dec-10,Vol. 6,259-283 ,
273,South African Constitutional Jurisprudence: The First Fifteen Years, D.M. Davis,"South Africa became a constitutional democracy in 1994. This article reviews the first 15years of constitutional jurisprudence produced by the country's first Constitutional Court. While the court interpreted the Constitution to eradicate racist, sexist, and homophobic legislation and similar common law rules, it did little to promote a comprehensive transformation of the legal system and thus the patterns of distribution that were supported by the law. This is illustrated particularly in the area of social and economic rights. The conclusion is thus reached that the new legal foundations are insufficiently resilient to hold the weight of constitutional expectation.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152919,Dec-10,Vol. 6,285-300 ,

But debates over the character and content of bills of rights are no longer at the center of more recent rounds of postconflict constitutional politics. This review puzzles through the rise and decline, but persistence, of rights-based constitutionalism. Neither comparative constitutional law nor constitutional politics offers the answer. The literature on civil war settlement suggests that bills of rights serve two functions in postconflict constitutions: a regulative role to check the abuse of public power and a constitutive role to serve as the basis of a new constitutional identity. Bills of rights cannot do the work that is expected of them. Politicized judiciaries, constitutional underenforcement, and the ex post nature of judicial review undermine the ability of the bill of rights to serve as a credible commitment against future abuses of human rights. Moreover, the idea of a bill of rights as a source of shared political identity abstracted from a contingent political and historical context is unlikely to succeed in practice.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131445,Dec-10,Vol. 6,301-322 ,

Alexa Koenig,"In 1965, Yale Kamisar authored “Equal Justice in the Gatehouses and Mansions of American Criminal Procedure,” an article that came to have an enormous impact on the development of criminal procedure and American norms of criminal justice. Today, that article is a seminal work of scholarship, hailed for “playing a significant part in producing some of the [Warren] Court's most important criminal-procedure decisions” (White 2003–2004), including Miranda v. Arizona. The most influential concept Kamisar promoted may have been his recognition of a gap that loomed between the Constitutional rights actualized in mansions (courts) versus gatehouses (police stations). Kamisar passionately detailed how the Constitution and its jurisprudential progeny failed to protect suspects when those rights mattered most: when facing questioning by police. This article discusses where this thesis stands today in light of nearly 50years of legal developments and social science research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152938,Dec-10,Vol. 6,323-339 ,
276,The Strategic Analysis of Judicial Decisions, Lee Epstein and  Tonja Jacobi,"Since the 1990s, there has been an explosion of empirical and theoretical work dedicated to advancing strategic accounts of law and legal institutions. Reviewing this extensive literature could be accomplished in multiple ways. We chose an approach that underscores a major contribution of strategic accounts: that they have forced scholars to think about the interdependent—i.e., strategic—nature of judicial decisions. On strategic accounts, in other words, judges do not make decisions in a vacuum, but rather take into account the preferences and likely actions of other relevant actors, including their colleagues, their judicial superiors, and members of the other branches of government. After defining strategic analysis and how it differs from other approaches to judicial decisions, we examine the literature on the forms of strategic behavior in which (preference-maximizing) judges engage when interacting with these three sets of actors.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152921,Dec-10,Vol. 6,341-358 ,

In the twenty-first century, native peoples' involvement in environmental politics is becoming more assertive. In this context it is necessary to think about the impact indigenous involvement may have in shaping future U.S. environmental agendas and regulations. After briefly discussing the rise of environmental movements and environmental law in the United States, I turn to the historical treatment of native peoples and in particular the treatment of their natural resources. This historical backdrop is essential to understanding tribal status today under the Environmental Protection Agency, and the challenges some tribal governments now present to environmental exploitation and degradation by states and corporations. The review concludes by reflecting on the future of U.S. environmental law in the context of increasing pressure being exerted by international environmental law and global indigenous politics.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152820,Dec-10,Vol. 6,359-386 ,

But public opinion may be influenced by other political actors through the mass media instead. Scholars agree that the news media have become more attentive to and supportive of lesbian and gay rights over time, and they identify several factors as explanations for the change. While events, the gay rights movement, official statements, and government action may have had an effect, coverage was contingent on the decisions of news institutions and media owners to devote attention to them. There have been few studies on the media's impact, but decisions to cover the gay rights movement appear to have moved public opinion. Despite setbacks, continued debate over gay rights is likely to generate favorable media attention and lead to increased public support for lesbian and gay rights over time.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152825,Dec-10,Vol. 6,387-403 ,
279,Happiness Studies and Legal Policy, Peter Henry Huang,"Social scientists have conducted numerous empirical and experimental studies of self-reported happiness. This review focuses on two fundamental areas of research in happiness and law, namely alternative measures of happiness and various policies to foster happiness. There are many aspects, concepts, dimensions, and visions of happiness. Empirical findings often depend critically on which particular measure of happiness is analyzed. Happiness studies have applications to national well-being indices; policy evaluation; civil judicial and jury decision making about liability and damages in cases of sexual harassment, employment discrimination, and torts; optimal tax law design; family law; criminal sentencing; legal education; and legal practice. There are decision-making, health, productivity, and psychological benefits to various types of happiness. There are more or less paternalistic happiness interventions, including policies to encourage regular physical exercise, good sleep, and meditation. Hopefully, analysis of these topics offers exemplars of possibilities and limits to utilizing happiness studies in designing legal policy.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152828,Dec-10,Vol. 6,405-432 ,

Recent work has extended that research, with the result that tort law in action may be the best mapped of any legal field outside criminal law. Sociological research has begun to explore insurance as a form of governance, with effects in many legal fields and across the economy. This article reviews developments in both bodies of work. It examines the relationship between liability insurance and tort law in action using the metaphors of window and frame, as well as reviews research on insurance as governance. The conclusion returns to insurance as governance in the context of liability insurance, arguing that this is an especially promising field for sociolegal research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152839,Dec-10,Vol. 6,433-447 ,
281,The Debate over African American Reparations, John Torpey and  Maxine Burkett,"This article offers an overview of the debate over reparations for African Americans in the United States. We state the point in this way because there is little consensus about the cause of action for which reparations are sought, whether for slavery or segregation; for that matter, there is little agreement on the type of remedy reparations might effect. This raises the question of political mobilization for and popular views of reparations for African Americans. It is well known that whites and African Americans have very different perspectives on this issue. We seek to address the underlying reasons for and significance of this dissensus, stressing peculiarities of American political culture. Less discussed, however, have been the consequences for the reparations debate of recent historical developments in the United States—in particular, the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States. In addition to assessing the significance of these developments for the debate over reparations, we point to several new directions that the notion of reparations appears to be taking. We conclude with some thoughts about how reparations—understood chiefly in terms of their larger aim of enhancing racial equality—might realistically be achieved.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152901,Dec-10,Vol. 6,449-467 ,

The first generation of comparative work on race and slavery relied heavily on law to draw sharp contrasts between U.S. and Latin American slavery. Revisionist social historians criticized those scholars for providing a misleading top-down history of slavery based on metropolitan codes and instead emphasized demographic and economic factors that suggested pronounced variation in slavery regimes. However, social historians who study relationships of power in slaves' lives have found that they must reckon with law and legal institutions. Recently, legal historians have also begun to explore slave law from the bottom up: through slaves' claims in court, trial-level adjudications, and interactions among ordinary people and low-level government officials. Most studies of slavery stay within one national context, but a few scholars have begun comparative work once more, some examining slavery and freedom in the transnational context of the Atlantic world, others attempting comparisons of manumission in localities across legal regimes.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152924,Dec-10,Vol. 6,469-485 ,

The idea that race is socially constructed has become widely accepted, and studies increasingly have explored law's role in shaping racial categories, racial conflict, racial ideology, and the racial order. Fewer studies have utilized a well-developed concept of race to examine how it has affected legislation, legal processes, legal ideology, and so forth. To explore how law and race are mutually constitutive, I draw on examples from a dozen monographs (all but one published since 1999) that are in-depth case studies of how law and race have interacted in diverse geographical regions over the past 400years. Cumulatively, they present new insights about how law and race are coconstructed to reproduce and transform racial inequality in society. They represent an emerging genre of sociolegal studies that reveals how law and race shape each other in an ongoing, dialectic process.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131508,Dec-10,Vol. 6,487-505 ,
284,The Comparative Politics of Carbon Taxation, Kathryn Harrison,"Cap and trade and carbon taxes offer the prospect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a lower cost to society than conventional regulation. Between these two market-based approaches, however, carbon taxes offer significant advantages, including transparency and predictability of costs, ease of implementation, and application to small and large sources alike. This article thus seeks to inform our understanding of the conditions under which carbon taxes are politically viable by comparing the experience of four jurisdictions: Finland and Denmark, which adopted carbon taxes; Germany, which adopted a related energy tax; and Canada, which rejected a carbon tax. The cases highlight the role of policy entrepreneurs in advancing academic theories about environmental taxation. However, the impact of those ideas was conditional on voters' attention to either the environmental or economic benefits of carbon taxes. Even then, business tended to be more attentive, thus winning tax concessions relative to households. Proportional electoral systems tended to facilitate adoption of carbon taxes, whereas international institutions had mixed effects, in some cases advancing harmonization and in others undermining resolve for unilateral taxation.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131545,Dec-10,Vol. 6,507-529 ,

Heimer and  JuLeigh Petty,"Much of the literature on human subject regulation asserts that Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) have failed at the task of regulating human subjects research. These critiques of IRB law can be grouped into three loose categories: critiques of IRB law as law, critiques of IRBs as regulation, and critiques of IRBs as a system of norm creation. Moving beyond critique, we rethink the literature on IRBs drawing on the tools and scholarship of the social sciences. In particular, we examine human subjects regulation as an insufficient remedy to inequalities between weak and powerful actors, as a site of professional claims- and career-making, and as an occasion for institutionalization. Finally, distinguishing between the regulation of science and the regulation of ethics, we observe that the latter is far more difficult because ethics are contextual and subject to social construction. For these reasons, IRBs often substitute bureaucratic ethics for professional ethics.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131454,Dec-10,Vol. 6,601-626 ,

Within these traditions, we distinguish between structural and processual styles of research, noting the empirical methods favored in each tradition, research that blurs the boundaries between the traditions, and vanguard scholarship.

We review the literature on each pair of institutions and then suggest ways in which insights about the omitted institution might inform extant work. Finally, we offer a new framework for examining social movements, organizations, and law together.

291,Morality in the Law: The Psychological Foundations of Citizens’ Desires to Punish Transgressions,,"Evidence from a number of research methods converges to suggest that when a person registers a transgression against self or others, the person experiences an intuitively produced, emotionally tinged reaction of moral outrage. The reaction is driven by the just deserts–based retributive reactions of the person to the transgression rather than, for instance, considerations of the deterrent force of the punishment. In experimental games arranged so that trust and fairness transgressions occur, participants punish transgressors and experience rewarding brain states while doing so, and they punish even if they were not themselves the target of the violation. What, if any, implications does this have for the punishment component of societal systems of justice? Would it be possible to construct sentencing practices that, to some extent, incorporated citizens’ sense of just punishments? What would be gained by doing so?

In 1996, the U.S. Congress and President Clinton committed to “ending welfare as we know it” and changed welfare to workfare. Under the “work first” strategy, recipients are pressured to take the first entry-level job they are offered. Caseworkers, overworked and undertrained, are under pressure to produce favorable statistical results. They concentrate on those who are the most employable or take the least amount of time to become employable. Left out are those who have significant barriers to employment. There has been a rapid decline in welfare caseloads. Most who left the rolls have been sanctioned, have been denied entry to welfare, have taken low-paid work, and remain in poverty. This welfare-to-work strategy has spread to other parts of the developed world. Faced with sluggish economies and growing unemployment, welfare states have been changed from passive to active. Welfare has become targeted and conditional, in what is now termed active labor market policy.

I begin by defining willpower, disaggregating it from other, related problems, and considering the terms of the intraself conflict it implies. Drawing on ideas that are well recognized in the literature, I divide the costs of willpower lapses and their prevention into the failure costs of bad decisions, the exercise costs associated with exerting willpower effort, and the erosion costs that individuals and society as a whole might incur over time if willpower is not regularly exercised. After surveying a variety of possible policy responses to self-control problems, I offer some suggestions for future research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131535,1-Dec-09,Vol. 5,91-113 ,

Then I discuss how pluralism has come to be seen as an attractive analytical framework for those interested in studying law on the world stage. Finally, I identify advantages of a pluralist approach and respond to criticisms, and I suggest ways in which pluralism can help both in reframing old conceptual debates and in generating useful normative insights for designing procedural mechanisms, institutions, and discursive practices for managing hybrid legal/cultural spaces.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131539,1-Dec-09,Vol. 5,225-242 ,
302,Global Legal Pluralism, Ralf Michaels,"Some challenges of legal globalization closely resemble those formulated earlier for legal pluralism: the irreducible plurality of legal orders, the coexistence of domestic state law with other legal orders, the absence of a hierarchically superior position transcending the differences. This review discusses how legal pluralism engages with legal globalization and how legal globalization utilizes legal pluralism. It demonstrates how several international legal disciplines—comparative law, conflict of laws, public international law, and European Union law—have slowly begun to adopt some ideas of legal pluralism. It shows how traditional themes and questions of legal pluralism—the definition of law, the role of the state, of community, and of space—are altered under conditions of globalization. It addresses interrelations between different legal orders and various ways, both theoretical and practical, to deal with them. And it provides an outlook on the future of global legal pluralism as theory and practice of global law.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172311,1-Dec-09,Vol. 5,243-262 ,
303,Recursivity of Global Normmaking: A Sociolegal Agenda, Terence C. Halliday,"This review proposes that the recursivity of law offers a promising framework for sociolegal and interdisciplinary research on global norm-making. The recursivity approach is systematic, generates hypotheses and questions about global actors and mechanisms, takes seriously historical contingency, and is inherently comparative across issue areas and different levels of governance. In global lawmaking, recursivity proceeds principally through the intersection of three interacting cycles of global normmaking, national lawmaking, and the interaction between the two. With particular focus on genocide and war crimes, violence against women, trade law, and climate change, the review demonstrates how four mechanisms—actor mismatch, diagnostic struggles, contradictions, and indeterminacy—drive forward these cycles of reform until the inherent tensions within them are resolved and normmaking settles. A sociolegal approach to the recursivity of global normmaking emphasizes (a) the politics of the legal complex, (b) the constitutive power of legal concepts, (c) the structure and dynamics of global regulatory institutions, and (d) the formal properties of global law. The review concludes with generalizations about global normmaking and particularly promising topics for sociolegal scholarship.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131606,1-Dec-09,Vol. 5,263-289 ,
304,Rethinking Sovereignty in International Law, Antony Anghie,"Sovereignty has always been a controversial topic in international law. The most prominent attempts to rethink sovereignty in recent times have arisen out of the policies of the Bush administration, particularly its conceptualization of self-defense and its attempts to promote democracy worldwide. This review explores the debates surrounding these initiatives and the larger theoretical issues they raise about the relationship between international law and sovereignty. International law has long struggled with the problem of how sovereign states that make international law can also be bound by it. Self-defense raises this problem in a particularly acute form because it is one of the fundamental rights of sovereignty and because it can be seen to precede the law itself. The review also explores the various ways in which the relationship between democracy and international law has been examined in the recent literature. Many of the analyses of sovereignty rely, either implicitly or explicitly, on distinctions between different types of states—democratic versus nondemocratic or, more broadly, responsible versus irresponsible states. The broad argument of this review is that the Bush administration's policies attempt to create an international legal system that resembles in many ways a return to the imperial international law of the nineteenth century.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172355,1-Dec-09,Vol. 5,291-310 ,
305,Does Torture Work? A Sociolegal Assessment of the Practice in Historical and Global Perspective, Lisa Hajjar,"Torture is absolutely prohibited and constitutes one of the core crimes under international law. There is a substantial body of sociolegal literature that addresses torture's illegality. But this article tackles the question “does torture work?” The analysis locates the practice of torture in historical and global perspective, accommodating but not constrained by post-9/11 scholarship on American torture. The titular question is treated more critically and comprehensively than a narrowly construed focus on the value and veracity of utterances produced as a result of pain and suffering. Drawing on scholarship from a variety of fields, the article addresses how torture works (i.e., why it has been used and its effects) in order to highlight the role of torture in the mutually constitutive histories of law-state-society relations. The final section uses the American case to offer conclusions about the efficacy and effects of torture.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131501,1-Dec-09,Vol. 5,311-345 ,
306,The Empirical Study of Terrorism: Social and Legal Research, Gary LaFree and  Gary Ackerman,"Social science research on terrorism has grown rapidly in recent years, aided by social and legal studies. In this review, we examine research on the causes of terrorism and the effectiveness of strategies for countering it. We define terrorism as the threatened or actual use of illegal force directed against civilian targets by nonstate actors in order to attain a political goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. Our review of causes is divided by level of analysis into sections on individual-, group-, and macro-level explanations. Our evaluation of counterterrorism strategies includes reviews of legal, criminal justice, military, and legitimacy campaigns. Psychopathological approaches have been largely discredited; however, evidence suggests that certain experiences, attitudes, and behaviors are overrepresented among terrorists. The potential impact of ideology, leadership, popular support, Diasporic communities, and socialization on group dynamics all provide fertile areas for additional research. Terrorism feeds on the ability of groups to portray governments and their agents as illegitimate. There is also evidence for high rates of terrorism in countries that are in democratic transition or are described as failed states. Research on connections between religious motives and terrorism is mixed. Although research on the efficacy of counterterrorism methods has grown rapidly in recent years, it is still rarely evaluated with strong empirical methods. All of these conclusions are qualified by the fact that both individual- and group-level empirical data on terrorism are in short supply.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131517,1-Dec-09,Vol. 5,347-374 ,
307,Public Support for Civil Liberties Pre- and Post-9/11, John L. Sullivan and  Henriët Hendriks,"Public support for civil liberties has undergone important changes in the past 50 years, as has scholarship on this topic. Whereas the American public was very intolerant of communists, socialists, and atheists in the 1950s and 1960s, current intolerance is now focused more on Muslim Americans and right-wing racists, among other groups. What has remained consistent is the important role played in shaping citizens’ tolerant and intolerant attitudes by their individual characteristics, such as education, authoritarianism, dogmatism, religiosity, and race. Although threat perceptions have always played an important role in explaining citizens’ support for civil liberties, this variable has gained new meaning in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Meanwhile, improved survey methodology now allows us to understand better the extent of democratic tolerance among Americans. In this article, we review the state of the literature on public support for civil liberties prior to 9/11 and, because we believe the terrorist attacks dramatically changed the political context, after 9/11.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131525,1-Dec-09,Vol. 5,375-391 ,
308,The Expanding Purview of Cultural Properties and Their Politics, Rosemary J. Coombe,"Cultural property is a field of law and politics that has expanded dramatically in the past two decades. The review explores the international legal, political, economic, and technological terrain in which possessive relations to cultural forms have been articulated and incited, as well as the revitalization of human rights claims premised upon cultural grounds. Changing practices, behaviors, attitudes, and protocols regarding cultural heritage both index and reflect transformations in social relationships that are indicative of larger patterns of late modernity and decolonization. This premise is illustrated through considerations of changing practices in cultural heritage preservation, archaeological and curatorial relationships to indigenous heritage properties, development institutions and programs, uses of intellectual property, and the treatment of traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expression. A new body of negotiated proprieties is emerging in a space of unprecedented legal pluralism that constitutes a significant area for sociolegal inquiry.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131448,1-Dec-09,Vol. 5,393-412 ,
309,Home Away from Home: Collaborative Research Networks and Interdisciplinary Socio-Legal Scholarship,Stuart A. Scheingold,"Interdisciplinary research has long been suspect within the disciplines. Because the disciplines control recruitment, tenure, and promotion, it is difficult for interdisciplinary scholarship to gain traction in the academic world. Within socio-legal scholarship, the Law and Society Association has been instrumental in fostering interdisciplinary and, more recently, transnational research. The association's latest and certainly one of its most promising interdisciplinary and international initiatives is the creation of Collaborative Research Networks (CRNs). These CRNs, while of relatively recent origin, have already contributed impressively. On the one hand, they have established structures and processes that provide opportunities, training, and rewards for interdisciplinary scholars. On the other hand, the CRNs have demonstrated the multiplicity of ways in which socio-legal scholarship can bring all manner of research tools to bear on topics that cross disciplinary and national boundaries—incorporating the global and the local as well as the mediating forces and institutions betwixt and between.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172346,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,1-12,
310,"Conditionality: Forms, Function, and History", Sarah L. Babb* and  Bruce G. Carruthers*,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is famous for its practice of conditionality—making the disbursement of resources to national governments contingent on the performance of certain policies. We survey the history of conditionality and show that the IMF is only one of many organizations that have historically engaged in this practice. Conditionality can be imposed by either private lenders (such as banks) or official organizations (such as international financial institutions), through a range of policy instruments, and to serve different kinds of goals. Over the course of the twentieth century, the conditionality of private lenders came to be replaced by official conditionality and was increasingly applied exclusively to the governments of developing countries. Today, conditionality is being used by more official organizations to address a broader range of goals than ever before. At the same time, however, conditionality is beset by critics who argue that it is illegitimate or ineffective. In response to such criticisms, the IMF and other practitioners of conditionality have developed new techniques and have attempted to bolster their legitimacy by making their operations more transparent and by emphasizing recipient-country participation.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172254,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,13-29 ,
311,"Organizations, Regulation, and Economic Behavior: Regulatory Dynamics and Forms from the Nineteenth to Twenty-First Century", Marc Schneiberg* and  Tim Bartley*,"Current scholarship suggests that instead of fueling deregulation and a race to the bottom, globalization and neoliberalism often go hand in hand with the expansion of regulatory rules and agents. We survey efforts to address this paradox. Building on analyses of nineteenth- and twentieth-century regulation, research on the current period has produced two critical analytical advances. It has developed new, multilevel conceptions of globalization, international interdependence, and their effects on regulation. Moreover, in grappling with new regulatory experiments, research has moved beyond command and control to reconceptualize regulation as an institutional form. Yet in its haste to understand the new century, this research has barely begun to produce systematic analyses of whether and how new forms are translated into practice and shape organizational behavior. It also assumes discontinuity between new forms and their bureaucratic predecessors, leaving unexplored how concepts developed for the new century can shed new light on pre-twenty-first-century forms. We propose strategies for future research on both these fronts.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172338,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,31-61 ,
312,The Political Economy of American Indian Gaming, Stephen Cornell,"Since the late 1980s, the commercial gaming industry has grown rapidly on American Indian reservations. Today, more than 200 Indian nations own more than 400 gaming operations in 28 states, yielding revenues in 2006 of more than $25 billion. How did this come about and what are the effects on Indian nations and on non-Native communities? The organization of contemporary Indian gaming operations has its roots in tribal-state conflicts dating to the late 1970s. It is a governmental activity, carried out by tribal governments on the basis of the preexisting rights of Indian nations, although it has been substantially constrained by congressional legislation and federal court decisions. While gaming's effects are unevenly distributed across tribes, its political, economic, and social impacts on many Indian reservations have been significant and positive, and it has had positive economic effects on many non-Native communities as well, particularly in distressed areas. But our understanding of gaming's effects is hindered by a lack of comprehensive case studies of gaming-related tribal decision making and of gaming's effects on both Native and non-Native communities.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172343,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,63-82 ,
313,After Inclusion," Devon Carbado,  Catherine Fisk, and  Mitu Gulati","What forms of discrimination are likely to be salient in the coming decade? This review flags a cluster of problems that roughly fall under the rubric of inclusive exclusions or discrimination by inclusion. Much contemporary discrimination theory and empirical work is concerned not simply with mapping the forces that keep people out of the labor market but also with identifying the forces that push them into hierarchical structures within workplaces and labor markets. Underwriting this effort is the notion that, although determining what happens before and during the moment in which a prospective employee is excluded from an employment opportunity remains crucial to antidiscrimination theory and practice, significant employment discrimination problems can occur after a person is hired and becomes an employee. These problems transcend racial and sexual harassment. They include a range of subtle institutional practices and interpersonal dynamics that create systemic advantages for some employees and disadvantages for others. We predict that the next generation of race discrimination scholarship will engage these “after inclusion” workplace difficulties theoretically, empirically, and doctrinally.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172323,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,83-102 ,
314,Divergent Paths: Conflicting Conceptions of Employment Discrimination in Law and the Social Sciences," Robert L. Nelson,  Ellen C. Berrey, and  Laura Beth Nielsen","Legal conceptions of employment discrimination have become increasingly narrow over the past two decades as the law has adopted a “perpetrator” model of discrimination that emphasizes purposeful intent. This tendency runs counter to social scientific research that documents the pervasiveness of unintentional bias and the persistence of organizational processes that generate workplace discrimination. This narrow legal conception, coupled with a system of employment discrimination litigation that emphasizes individual claims and individual remedies, fails to support the organizational approaches that are most promising for redressing workplace discrimination. We review the literature on employment discrimination law, discrimination litigation, continuing patterns of racial and gender inequality, the organizational bases of discrimination, and the impact of equal employment law on organizations. We conclude by discussing the reasons for and implications of this divergence between law and social science.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115934,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,103-122 ,
315,Providing Expert Knowledge in an Adversarial Context: Social Cognitive Science in Employment Discrimination Cases, Susan T. Fiske and  Eugene Borgida,"Quality science provides the foundation for expert testimony in court, a claim illustrated here by three established principles of social cognition frequently applied to litigation in employment discrimination cases. First, dual processes, automatic and controlled, underlie “hidden” bias. The Implicit Association Test exemplifies one controversial but scientifically tractable application of such automaticity principles. Second, encoding and attention reveal incredibly early bias. Their potential application via neuroscience in the courtroom will challenge both science and the law. Third, mental construal produces categorical representation. Legal applications show categories’ tenacity despite commonsense expectations about the impact of individuating information. Psychological scientists, expert witnesses, legal scholars, legal practitioners, and organizational managers each benefit when quality science is imported into legal contexts. Normal science disagreements should not mistakenly tarnish the credibility of quality science.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172350,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,123-148 ,
316,Failed Forensics: How Forensic Science Lost Its Way and How It Might Yet Find It, Michael J. Saks and  David L. Faigman,"A group of nonscience forensic sciences has developed over the past century. These are fields within the broader forensic sciences that have little or no basis in actual science. They are not applications of established basic sciences, they have not systematically tested their own hypotheses, and they make unsupported assumptions and exaggerated claims. This review explains the nature and origins of those nonscience forensic fields, which include the forensic individualization sciences and certain other areas, such as fire and arson investigation. We explore the role of the courts in maintaining the underdeveloped state of these fields and consider suggestions for improving this state of affairs (addressing the potential role that could be played by these fields themselves, by the courts, and by normal sciences).",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172303,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,149-171 ,
317,Convicting the Innocent, Samuel R. Gross,"Almost everything we know about false convictions is based on exonerations in rape and murder cases, which together account for only 2% of felony convictions. Within that important but limited sphere we have learned a lot in the past 30 years; outside it, our ignorance is nearly complete. This review describes what we now know about convicting the innocent: estimates of the rate of false convictions among death sentences; common causes of false conviction for rape or murder; demographic and procedural predictors of such errors. It also explores some of the types of false convictions that almost never come to light—innocent defendants who plead guilty rather than go to trial, who receive comparatively light sentences, who are convicted of crimes that did not occur (as opposed to crimes committed by other people), who are sentenced in juvenile court—in fact, almost all innocent defendants who are convicted of any crimes other than rape or murder. Judging from what we can piece together, the vast majority of false convictions fall in these categories. They are commonplace events, inconspicuous mistakes in ordinary criminal investigations that never get anything close to the level of attention that sometimes leads to exoneration.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172300,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,173-192 ,
318,The Psychology of Confessions, Saul M. Kassin,"Despite the potency of confession evidence in criminal law, recent DNA exonerations indicate that false confessions are a contributing factor in numerous wrongful convictions. After distinguishing between voluntary, compliant, and internalized false confessions, this article reviews research implicating a sequence of three processes responsible for false confessions and the adverse consequences of these confessions. First, police often target innocent people for interrogation because of erroneous judgments of truth and deception made during preinterrogation interviews. Second, innocent people are sometimes induced to confess as a function of certain police interrogation tactics, dispositional suspect vulnerabilities, and naive mental state that accompanies innocence. Third, people cannot readily distinguish between true and false confessions and often fail to discount those confessions they perceive to be coerced. At present, researchers are seeking ways to improve the accuracy of confession evidence and its evaluation in the courtroom.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172410,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,193-217 ,
319,Forecasting Methods in Crime and Justice, Richard Berk,"Researchers who study crime and justice have been forecasting a variety of outcomes for nearly a century. Perhaps the most well known are forecasts of behavior after release from prison. Other examples include forecasts of prison populations and time trends in crime. However, it is very difficult to determine how accurate such forecasts have been because few forecasts have been properly evaluated. In the hope of improving crime and justice forecasts in the future, this article reviews modern forecasting methods and their applications to crime and justice questions. Among the key challenges for researchers are how best to arrive at useful forecasting models, taking the costs of forecasting errors into account, and estimating nonlinear relationships.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112812,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,219-238 ,
320,Undercover Policing and the Shifting Terms of Scholarly Debate: The United States and Europe in Counterpoint, Jacqueline E. Ross,"Among investigative tactics, undercover policing is unique in the extent to which it allows the police to shape the events they investigate. Yet this shared feature of undercover investigations produces very different academic controversies in the United States and Europe. European scholars fear the implications of legalizing tactics that had previously been tolerated, if at all, at the margins of legality. By contrast, American commentators seek to unsettle what they view as complacency about a tactic that is used far more widely in the United States than in Europe. In Italy and Germany, a long tradition of scholarship in criminal law treats police infiltration as a problem of government law-breaking. In France, a distinguished sociological tradition views undercover tactics as a privileged terrain of turf warfare between competing government agencies. Because of their interest in the entrapment defense, American academics focus largely on the criminal responsibility of targets, not operatives. More recently, American and European scholars have shifted their interest away from the criminal law, with its emphasis on the individual criminal liability of targets and undercover operatives, toward the exploration of new means for distributing responsibility among complementary institutional actors like police, prosecutors, and judges. Undercover policing has thus increasingly become a problem of criminal procedure, in which undercover tactics have come to be framed as threats to privacy, freedom of association, trial rights, and other civil liberties. As criminal investigations become increasingly transnational, criminal procedure has provided a shared framework of criticism and a familiar repertoire of solutions, facilitating national comparisons and sometimes muting national differences in regulatory norms and approach.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172416,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,239-273 ,
321,Jury Systems Around the World, Valerie P. Hans,"Lay citizens participate as decision makers in the legal systems of many countries. This review describes the different approaches that countries employ to integrate lay decision makers, contrasting in particular the use of juries composed of all citizens with mixed decision-making bodies of lay and law-trained judges. The review discusses research on the benefits and drawbacks of lay legal decision making as well as international support for the use of ordinary citizens as legal decision makers, with an eye to explaining a recent increase in new jury systems around the world. The review calls for more comparative work on diverse approaches to lay participation, examining how different methods of including lay participation promote or detract from fact finding, legal consciousness, civic engagement, and citizen power.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172319,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,275-297 ,

Scholars of legal history, sociology, economics, organizational behavior, and law have examined various dimensions of the feminization of the legal profession. This review traces the parameters of integration and inequality in the careers of women and men in the contemporary legal profession.

A common feature of those changes is the introduction of elements of the American system of legal education. Although traditional legal education in these countries has been provided at an undergraduate level and has not been considered professional legal education, recent and current reforms in those countries are either adding postgraduate professional law schools to existing undergraduate legal education or replacing undergraduate legal education with postgraduate professional law schools. The main parts of this review describe key features of those reforms in the three countries.

324,The Countermajoritarian Difficulty: From Courts to Congress to Constitutional Order, Mark A. Graber,"This review documents how scholarly concern with democratic deficits in American constitutionalism has shifted from the courts to electoral institutions. Prominent political scientists are increasingly rejecting the countermajoritarian difficulty as the proper framework for studying and evaluating judicial power. Political scientists, who study Congress and the presidency, however, have recently emphasized countermajoritarian difficulties with electoral institutions. Realistic normative appraisals of American political institutions, this emerging literature on constitutional politics in the United States maintains, should begin by postulating a set of democratic and constitutional goods, determine the extent to which American institutions as a whole are delivering those goods, and either explain how the political system as a whole might be redesigned to better deliver those goods or accept second-best constitutional goods that can actually be delivered by some attainable combination of political institutions.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172404,1-Dec-08,Vol. 4,361-384 ,
325,Toward a New Sociology of Rights: A Genealogy of “Buried Bodies” of Citizenship and Human Rights, Margaret R. Somers and  Christopher N.J. Roberts,"Although a thriving social science literature in citizenship has emerged in the past two decades, to date there exists neither a sociology of rights nor a sociology of human rights. Theoretical obstacles include the association of rights with the philosophical discourse of normativity, the abstraction of universalism, and the individualism attributed to rights-bearers. Parallel historical obstacles dating from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948 include American exceptionalism and racism, cultural relativism, the institutional primacy of sovereignty, and the privileging of civil rights over socioeconomic rights. Except in the United States, today human rights discourse is the lingua franca of global struggles*; building a sociology of rights as a collective project is now imperative. This article unearths and reconstructs 60 years of political clashes, intellectual debates, and struggles for inclusion and recognition surrounding human rights and citizenship—much of which has been hidden from history (especially African American human rights movements). We introduce a nascent but uncoordinated social science attention to rights and develop criteria for a new sociology of rights. At the nexus of human rights and citizenship rights we identify the public good of a “right to have rights,” which expresses the institutional, social, and moral preconditions for human recognition and inclusion. The concept offers a promising avenue of social science inquiry.

326,"Immigration Law, Race, and Identity",,"This review examines the scholarship at the intersection of immigration law, race, and identity. Historically, much of the literature has focused on the ways immigration law has constructed, and been constructed by, racial categories. I argue that African American racialization has been a central component of immigrant exclusion and that immigrant racialization has paradoxically hardened images of blackness. Whereas this literature emphasizes the role of law in this process, much of the more recent literature decenters law. This scholarship privileges issues of identity construction, with the fluidity and contingency of racial identity taking center stage. Despite this decentering, law clearly still matters. Examining the reference to Hurricane Katrina victims as “refugees” and the vehement reaction against that reference, we can see the complexities of the connection between racial construction and immigration and the implications for future scholarship.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112745,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,1-20,

This is true in many fields, including law. This review considers how the recent emphasis on quantitative accountability has influenced law and legal practices. Rather than offering a broad survey of quantitative techniques deployed in law, the article examines three legal contexts in which quantification has shaped how actors are held accountable: sentencing guidelines, cost-benefit analysis in regulation, and law school rankings. The conditions that promote rigorous quantification, its effects on professional discretion, relations of authority, and resistance are examined.

328,How Autonomous Is Law?, Christopher Tomlins,"Socio-legal scholars forever debate whether law is the product of internally constructed rules, procedures, and rationales or an effect of external social forces and interests. Traditionally, the debate pitted formalists who defended law's actual autonomy against instrumentalists who claimed law was a creature of exogenous circumstance. The debate was transformed in the later twentieth century, first by fundamental refinements in Marxist theory that produced structuralist accounts of law's relative autonomy, then by poststructural innovations in critical theory which held that all discourses (including law) were epistemically autonomous. Parallel formulations claimed not only that law was autonomous but also that law was in fact constitutive of the very social circumstances once held to determine its development. This article reviews the highlights of the debate while adopting a perspective outside it. It treats the autonomy question as relational—if law is autonomous it must still be autonomous in relation to something—and asks in relation to what?

Law produces social change through a combination of rational adaptation to legal incentive structures, cultural meaning making and institutional diffusion, and political mobilization and counter-mobilization. Substantive effects-oriented administrative, adjudicative, and organizational interpretations of welfare-oriented legislation maximizes inequality reduction. These interpretations are most likely to be achieved through a combination of collective mobilization for strategic litigation in conjunction with sustained political mobilization from below both in society and in organizations, accompanied by the influence in implementation and also active monitoring by law and social science–savvy reformers representing the interests of disadvantaged classes and groups.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112728,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,69-97 ,
330,The Rule of Law, John K.M. Ohnesorge,"Rule of Law rhetoric is increasingly common, both in U.S. legal literature and in the realm of international governance. In the field of law and economic development, the Rule of Law revival is lead by the international financial institutions (IFIs). Rule of Law discourse has also come to play an important role in the fields of comparative politics and comparative law, particularly with respect to East Asia. This review begins with a discussion of Rule of Law rhetoric in the Anglo-American tradition. It then discusses the international Rule of Law renaissance, focusing on the roles that Rule of Law rhetoric plays in the development activities of the IFIs. Because the claim is that the Rule of Law is key to economic development, this review explores the extent to which Northeast Asia's outstanding economic development conformed to the Rule of Law. An exploration follows of how the Rule of Law–economic development literature has evolved over time, in line with changing ideas about economics and about development itself. Finally, this review explores how Rule of Law is used in the literatures of comparative politics and comparative law.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.011207.080748,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,99-114 ,
331,Islamic Constitutionalism, Saïd Amir Arjomand,"As the first survey of the topic, this review covers Islamic constitutionalism since its emergence a century ago, showing a significant range of historical variation. The first two phases of Islamic constitutionalism are separated by a watershed, the late coming of the age of ideology, which began with the creation of Pakistan in 1947, thus predating the contemporary resurgence of Islam by some two decades. In the first phase, Islam appeared as a limitation to government and legislation, without any presumption that it should be the basis of the constitution itself. In the second phase, Islam came to be considered the basis of the constitution and the state. In the incipient third phase of postideological Islamic constitutionalism, we witness a return to the idea of limited government—this time as the rule of law according to a constitution that is not based on but is inclusive of the principles of Islam as the established religion.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112753,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,115-140 ,
332,"The Emergence, Content, and Institutionalization of Hate Crime Law: How a Diverse Policy Community Produced a Modern Legal Fact", Valerie Jenness,"This review provides an overview of the emergence, content, and institutionalization of hate crime law as a unique form of criminal and civil rights law originating in the United States and increasingly finding a home in other countries. From the introduction and politicization of the term hate crime in the late 1970s to the increased enforcement of hate crime law at the beginning of the twenty-first century, social movements have constructed the problem of hate-motivated violence; politicians at the federal and state levels have passed legislation defining the parameters of hate crime; appellate court judges have decided the constitutionality of hate crime law; and law enforcement officials have classified, reported, investigated, and prosecuted incidents as hate crime. At the same time, media attention to hate crime has increased, defining the concept for the masses while leading to and reflecting growing acceptance of the idea that criminal conduct is different when it involves an act motivated by (some types of) bigotry, hatred, or bias and manifested as discrimination against (some types of) minorities. An examination of these changes suggests that lawmaking transcends the moment at which a statute is adopted; it is best understood as a larger process of policy domain formation that is enabled and constrained by a policy community intimately connected to extralegal political processes and the workings of loosely coupled bureaucratic structures comprising the criminal justice system.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112733,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,141-160 ,
333,Restorative Justice: What Is It and Does It Work?, Carrie Menkel-Meadow,"This article reviews the now extensive literature on the varied arenas in which restorative justice is theorized and practiced—criminal violations, community ruptures and disputes, civil wars, regime change, human rights violations, and international law. It also reviews—by examining empirical studies of the processes in different settings—how restorative justice has been criticized, what its limitations and achievements might be, and how it might be understood. I explore the foundational concepts of reintegrative shaming, acknowledgment and responsibility, restitution, truth and reconciliation, and sentencing or healing circles for their transformative and theoretical potentials and for their actual practices in a variety of locations—family abuse, juvenile delinquency, criminal violations, problem-solving courts, indigenous-colonial-national disputes, ethnic and religious conflicts, civil wars, and liberation struggles. Restorative justice, which began as an alternative model of criminal justice, seeking healing and reconciliation for offenders, victims, and the communities in which they are embedded, has moved into larger national and international arenas of reintegration in political and ethnic conflicts. This review suggests that there are important and serious questions about whether restorative justice should be supplemental or substitutional of more conventional legal processes and about how its innovations suggest potentially transformative and challenging ideas and “moves” for dealing with both individual and group transgressive conduct, seeking peace as well as justice.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.110005,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,161-187 ,
334,Law and Collective Memory, Joachim J. Savelsberg and  Ryan D. King,"Law and collective memory are reciprocally associated. Law steers collective memory, directly but selectively, as trials produce images of the past through the production and presentation of evidence in ritual practices and public discourse. Law affects collective memory indirectly by regulating the production, accessibility, and dissemination of information about the past. Simultaneously, collective memory is preserved and activated by carrier groups to inform lawmaking and law enforcement; and memories of past atrocities serve as analogical devices that, under certain conditions, influence law. Such institutionalization of collective memory as law partly results from applied commemorations, lawmaking situations that invoke the past. The relevance of the reciprocal relationship between law and collective memory is highlighted by the international community's responses to recent atrocities and regime transitions and by its new openness to intervention in national affairs.

But was it different enough no longer to have a place in the new democracies of Eastern Europe? This review looks at the socialist features of pre-1989 East European law and suggests that Marxist law never existed in the first place; that the Stalinist aspects of socialist law, while not extinct, were not confined to the law of Eastern Europe and thus not necessarily socialist; and that the parental qualities of law in the former Soviet Bloc correspond well not only with the needs of unsettled and impoverished populations in Eastern Europe, but with the modern welfare state in general.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112849,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,233-253 ,
337,Legal Innovation and the Control of Gang Behavior, Eva Rosen and  Sudhir Venkatesh,"This review considers one of the most prominent methods of combating gang activity in the second half of the last century, namely the deployment of legal strategies to prevent gang formation and intervene in existing gang structures. These include highly formalized strategies, such as the enactment of legislative decrees such as injunctions that limit the association of gang members in public space, as well as informal procedures in which communities create an indigenous and localized set of norms and juridical procedures to fight gang activity. Research on legal tactics and gang control in the past few decades has shown that the formative understanding of the city as a social ecology of distinct and separate communities, in which social institutions and residents are largely attuned to activity occurring within their boundaries, remains at the heart of social policy formulation with respect to youth delinquency. The review addresses these major legal innovations and the debates surrounding them.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112724,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,255-270 ,
338,Punishment Beyond the Legal Offender, Megan Comfort,"In the United States, lawbreakers are treated as social isolates, and the sentences imposed upon them are conceived of as affecting a discrete individual. However, people who commit or are suspected of committing crimes are generally embedded in kinship webs and social networks that draw others into the ambit of the state's punishment apparatus. Through their association with someone convicted of a crime, legally innocent people have firsthand and often intense contact with criminal justice authorities and correctional facilities, they experience variants of the direct and indirect consequences of incarceration, and they are confronted by the paradox of a penal state that has become the primary distributor of social services for the poor in the United States. Collectively, studies investigating punishment beyond the offender contribute to the understanding of the wide and multi-faceted impact of punitive sanctions and spotlight the importance of considering this full range of repercussions when evaluating the scope of the nation's policing, judicial, and correctional policies.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112829,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,271-296 ,
339,The Effectiveness of Correctional Rehabilitation: A Review of Systematic Reviews, Mark W. Lipsey and  Francis T. Cullen,"The effects of correctional interventions on recidivism have important public safety implications when offenders are released from probation or prison. Hundreds of studies have been conducted on those effects, some investigating punitive approaches and some investigating rehabilitation treatments. Systematic reviews (meta-analyses) of those studies, while varying greatly in coverage and technique, display remarkable consistency in their overall findings. Supervision and sanctions, at best, show modest mean reductions in recidivism and, in some instances, have the opposite effect and increase reoffense rates. The mean recidivism effects found in studies of rehabilitation treatment, by comparison, are consistently positive and relatively large. There is, however, considerable variability in those effects associated with the type of treatment, how well it is implemented, and the nature of the offenders to whom it is applied. The specific sources of that variability have not been well explored, but some principles for effective treatment have emerged. The rehabilitation treatments generally found effective in research do not characterize current correctional practice, and bridging the gap between research and practice remains a significant challenge.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112833,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,297-320 ,
340,The Socio-Legal Implications of the New Biotechnologies, Alain Pottage,"This review explores a number of legal-theoretical studies of the encounter between law and biotechnology. Rather than attempt an extensive compilation of scholarship, the review focuses on those studies that have addressed the effects that biotechnologies (understood in the broadest sense) have had on the composition of legal form. Although the relation between law and biotechnology is often seen as being one in which law is applied to biotechnology as a kind of prohibitory limit or regulatory force, this review explores some of the ways in which biotechnological programs have challenged and eroded the conceptual form of law. The hypothesis is that there is an antagonistic relation between law and biotechnology and that this antagonism is brought out in scholarship relating to the key areas in which the encounter between law and biotechnology is played out: intellectual property, governance and regulation, and those domains of law that have incorporated technologies of DNA fingerprinting.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112856,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,321-344 ,

We assess both the magnitude and consequences of these developments, first describing the primary tools of IP and the changing nature of their influence on science, and then examining the effects of IP on the roles, rules, and relations of the scientific enterprise. We also consider the emergence of new models of scientific practice that blend both public and private. We debate whether current changes represent a transition or transformation in the relations between science and property. Finally, we argue that just as the public and private spheres of science may be converging, so must future scholarship if we are to answer harder questions about the appropriate balance between traditional logics of open science and the more recent regimes of proprietary science.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112900,1-Dec-07,Vol. 3,345-373 ,

This article reviews important empirical questions raised by this institutional turn in both law and social science. How have changes in the institutions of family and work contributed to work/family conflict? Have legal reforms produced more egalitarian sharing of care work between men and women? How do work organizations respond to these legal mandates? How have organizational and cultural institutions hindered or given support to laws that attempt to reform the relationship between work and family?

344,Implicit Social Cognition and Law," Kristin A. Lane,  Jerry Kang, and  Mahzarin R. Banaji","Experimental psychology has provided substantial evidence that the human mind can operate in automatic, uncontrollable fashion as well as without conscious awareness of its workings and the sources of influence on it. With methods available to measure implicit or less conscious aspects of social cognition, especially group-specific attitudes and stereotypes, several aspects of the nature of implicit social cognition are now regarded as well established. Such results primarily include the pervasive and robust implicit favoritism for one's own groups and socially dominant groups, the dissociation between implicit and explicit social cognition, the ability of both to predict behavior, the greater impact of the former on certain discriminatory behaviors, and the sensitivity of seemingly implicit thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to change in response to situational features and experience.

345,"In the Winter of Our Discontent: Law, Anti-Law, and Social Science",Marc Galanter," Abstract Law and social science took shape as a field of inquiry in the third quarter of the past century, an era of expanding rights and remedies and optimism about the capacity of law, government, and social science to address intractable social problems. It put down vigorous institutional roots in organizations, publications, teaching, and research that enabled it to survive the erosion of the reformist soil that nurtured it and to adapt to a new era in which the prevailing common sense is a jaundiced view that emphasizes the weaknesses, costs, and dangers of law. A significant body of research has rebutted many of the components of the jaundiced view, but with little effect on the prevailing folklore. The legal system's distinctive susceptibility to such misreadings and misrepresentations is aggravated by a late and weak development of empirical knowledge and a lack of credible guardians of its knowledge base.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105946,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,1-16,
346,Law and Social Movements: Contemporary Perspectives, Michael McCann,"▪ Abstract Social movement scholars have long seemed little interested in law, and traditional legal scholars were little interested in social movement analysis by social scientists. However, recent years have seen growth of interest in the topic of law and social movements, with inquiry led by political scientists and law and society scholars. This review surveys that diverse literature, beginning with general theory regarding core concepts and then moving to a review of empirical studies organized around the multi-stage model derived from political process approaches and legal mobilization frameworks. The primary argument of the review is that law is contingent, and how it matters for social movements varies with the context and character of struggle. Most analysts agree that law generally works to support status quo conventions and hierarchical relationships, but sometimes law can be mobilized to challenge and even reconstitute the terms of institutional order.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105917,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,17-38 ,
347,The Social and Legal Construction of Suspects, Simon A. Cole and  Michael Lynch,"▪ Abstract DNA profiling and searchable databases enhance the ability of policing organizations to search for criminal suspects. In many respects, these technologies are incorporated within traditions of police work, supplementing familiar “subjective” methods of constructing suspects. In other ways, however, the construction of DNA databases in Britain, the United States, and elsewhere shifts criminal investigation toward suspect populations and statistical suspects. Not only is DNA evidence used to confirm that a criminal suspect is the source of crime scene evidence, it can be used to search freely through a suspect population for a possible source of such evidence. This method, commonly known as database trawling, comprises a new way of constructing suspects, one that bears close connections with new data mining technologies for prospectively identifying terrorist suspects.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.110001,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,39-60 ,
348,Max Weber's Contribution to the Economic Sociology of Law, Richard Swedberg,"▪ Abstract During recent years, a few scholars have advocated that more attention be paid to the intersection of law, economics, and sociology—what may be called the economic sociology of law. This review suggests that a theoretical foundation for such a field of study, or parts of such a foundation, may be found in the work of Max Weber. It also provides an introduction to those parts of Weber's work that are relevant in this context. Weber especially emphasizes the role that law plays in raising the probability that actions will take place, in the economy and elsewhere, and that this probability has to be established while taking the motives of the actors into account. The main contribution of the legal system to modern capitalism, Weber also argues, is to make economic life more calculable.

350,The Death of Labor Law?, Cynthia L. Estlund,"▪ Abstract This review tells three interlocking tales of decline, each with its respective prognosis for recovery: the declines of labor law scholarship, labor law, and organized labor. The relationship between the latter two and the role that a reformed labor law might play in reviving organized labor are matters of continuing controversy. In the meantime, two developments on the ground suggest a way forward for organized labor, labor law, and labor law scholars. Activist unions have found success with a new organizing model: neutrality and card-check agreements. Elsewhere, antisweatshop activists are developing increasingly sophisticated supplier codes and monitoring schemes to improve labor standards in developing countries. Both strategies, with their basically contractual architecture, exemplify what regulatory scholars are calling new governance. These strategies suggest a potential way around the roadblocks that meet labor law reform proposals and toward more agile and responsive forms of workplace governance.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.110015,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,105-123 ,
351,The Crime Drop and Beyond, Alfred Blumstein and  Joel Wallman,"▪ Abstract Violent crime in the United States has traveled a striking path in the past 20 years, from a sharp spike in the late 1980s to a dramatic drop beginning around 1993 that lasted until a flattening occurred at the beginning of the new century. The upturn of the 1980s was driven almost exclusively by a sharp increase in gun violence among young people, whereas the downturn was a joint product of a turndown in youth violence and a steady drop in violence among adults over 30 that has been ongoing for at least 25 years. These trends have intrigued lay observers and students of crime alike, with advocates of various explanations of crime arguing that the key for the rise, fall, or both lies with one or another favored determinant: prisons, drugs, guns, policing, economics, or demography, including abortion. In this review, we discuss both the crime trends and their candidate explanations, concluding that the most reasonable accounts involve a complex interaction among several of these factors.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.110011,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,125-146 ,

Much of this research has emphasized identifying causal impacts, as opposed to correlations. These studies have generally found that increases in police and greater incarceration lead to reduced crime. The death penalty, as currently used in the United States, does not appear to lower crime.

The same period also witnessed the publication of much scholarship on Muslim personal or family law. This review focuses on these works and highlights their sophisticated theoretical treatments of social theory in critical areas, such as the interaction of normative orders, constructions and intersections of identity, human agency in the legal process, law reform and social movements, state uses of law, and the challenges facing globalizing societies.

Greenhouse,"▪ Abstract Based on a review of field-based scholarship on law published in English in 2004 and 2005, this review focuses on themes most strongly emergent across the disciplines of law and the social sciences: state regulation of the private sector, rights (individual rights, indigenous rights, and human rights), and security. These developing areas of field research show the impact of neoliberalism on the social fields of law, an impact intensified by the war on terror. They also point to fresh theoretical horizons in relation to issues of identity, hegemony, and the discursivity of state power. Although disciplines retain their distinctive questions and approaches, they reveal common attention to discourse and practice—particularly in relation to critical events in the war on terror and new forms of executive power, especially in the United States.

355,Networking Goes International: An Update, Anne-Marie Slaughter and  David Zaring,"▪ Abstract This literature review asks three questions of the scholarship on the regulatory networks that have so transformed global governance. First, what are these networks good for? We summarize the state of the literature on regulatory races, the fit between networks and the process of globalization, and the crucial role of the revolution in communications in the development of networks, introducing the topics with a brief intellectual history of regulatory network analysis in international relations and international law scholarship. Second, we examine how we can make sure that regulatory networks are good by asking this question: How might necessary and appropriate accountability mechanisms for the networks be constructed? The answers to these questions are at the foundation of a global administrative law, which is itself the subject of a burgeoning scholarly literature. Our third question concerns the way regulatory networks fit into a world where traditional intergovernmental relations and formally constituted international organizations are still important. We conclude by identifying different ways in which networks and international organizations can complement each other and by spotlighting questions for future research.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.120026,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,211-229 ,
356,From the Cold War to Kosovo: The Rise and Renewal of the Field of International Human Rights, Yves Dezalay and  Bryant Garth,"▪ Abstract This review explores the creation and transformation of the field of international human rights in the period after World War II. The narrative proceeds through an examination, based on documentary evidence and interviews, of three generations of human rights nongovernmental organizations: the International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch. Each was created in part to overcome the limitations of the previous generation, and the process, linked to developments in the U.S. field of state power and U.S. activities abroad—especially in Latin America—gradually produced a field with substantial legal autonomy. At the same time, however, the structure of the field moved increasingly close to U.S. power and the issues and strategies that would gain credibility in the United States. The autonomy is therefore structurally close to U.S. power.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.032406.145708,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,231-255 ,
357,Emergency Powers, William E. Scheuerman,"▪ Abstract This review considers competing models of emergency legal regulation in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Drawing on research in political science and political sociology, it criticizes recent debates about emergency powers among legal and constitutional scholars for ignoring the institutional dynamics of modern executive power, especially in presidential regimes. Constitutional relativists (e.g., Harvey Mansfield, Michael Stokes Paulsen, John Yoo), defenders of the extralegal model of emergency action (Oren Gross, Mark Tushnet), and common lawyers (David Cole, David Dyzenhaus) are criticized for failing to consider the pathologies likely generated by their proposals in an institutional context in which the executive possesses incentives for declaring, perpetuating, and exploiting emergency situations. Only a legal formalist perspective on emergency government (e.g., Bruce Ackerman) pays sufficient attention to the institutional dynamics of the contemporary executive.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.061206.074644,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,257-277 ,
358,The Law and Economics of Incomplete Contracts, Robert E. Scott,"▪ Abstract Individual actors want to make their promises enforceable in order to motivate mutually profitable investments. But parties cannot easily design contracts that maximize beneficial investments and also respond appropriately to changing conditions. Although economists have designed theoretical models that maximize joint welfare both ex ante and ex post, these mechanisms depend on a perfectly functioning and costless system of enforcement. In the real world, parties must expend substantial resources to enforce commitments legally, and, in many cases, courts lack information to assess the parties' actions. This review examines one of the main insights of the theory of incomplete contracts: that legal enforcement alone cannot ensure the full realization of jointly beneficial cooperative ventures. Legal enforcement, supported by the coercive power of the state, is only one mechanism for inducing cooperation, and in many relationships it typically has only a limited role to play. Complex contracts do lend themselves to effective formal enforcement. But parties often choose to write simple contracts that look to renegotiation once the future is known. Simple contracts require enforcement by informal mechanisms, such as reputation, repeated dealings, and norms of reciprocity in order to motivate both beneficial investment ex ante and adjustment ex post.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105913,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,279-297 ,
359,After Postcommunism: The Next Phase, Martin Krygier and  Adam Czarnota,"▪ Abstract This is a review, from a social scientific perspective, of law-related transformations in the formerly communist parts of Europe. It draws particularly on developments in East Central Europe. The frame of the discussion is a specific and interrelated group of questions: What are the distinctive features of these transformations, to what extent do these features endure, and what would it mean to say that the postcommunist region has entered a new phase? The review discusses the utility of the concepts “postcommunism” and “transition”; the goal of the rule of law, in the name of which many legal reforms have been made; particular problems that have arisen in relation to the judiciary, constitutional courts, and former secret police; and questions about “dealing with the past” as they have been asked about past institutions, people, and property rights. It concludes with a consideration of the likely impact of “joining Europe” on those countries that have been accepted as members of the European Union, on those that have not yet been accepted, and on those that are unlikely ever to be accepted.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105756,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,299-340 ,
360,Conspiracy in International Law, Jens Meierhenrich,"▪ Abstract This review examines the function of conspiracy in international law, with particular reference to the jurisprudence of international ad hoc tribunals. It compares and contrasts the function of conspiracy law in the prosecution of international crimes before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg following World War II, where the concept gave rise to a remarkably innovative and highly controversial conspiracy theory that revolved around the concept of “criminal organization,” and the function of conspiracy law in the prosecution of international crimes before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) at The Hague, where the concept has left a mark on a similarly innovative and equally controversial conspiracy theory that revolves around the concept of “joint criminal enterprise.” By tracing the function of conspiracy, this most controversial of U.S. legal transplants, in the international system, the review illuminates the significance of group dynamics in international law.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.050306.102350,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,341-357 ,
361,Law and the Labor Market, Christine Jolls,"▪ Abstract Legal rules governing the employer-employee relationship are many and varied. This review is concerned with the economic analysis of such rules. The review focuses on areas of employment regulation that have not been reviewed elsewhere from an economic perspective. Topics considered in the review include workplace safety regulation, privacy protection in the workplace, fringe benefits mandates, targeted mandates such as medical and family leave, and rules requiring that employees receive overtime pay. Both economic theory and empirical evidence are considered.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105925,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,359-385 ,
362,Transnational Legality and the Immobilization of Local Agency, David Schneiderman,"▪ Abstract The organizational logic of the legal rules and institutions of economic globalization treats as suspect economic regulation issuing out of the democratic processes of national and subnational communities. In this way, economic globalization can be likened to state formation: as a cultural project with the object of actively suppressing alternatives. While undermining the regulatory capacity of local publics to tame markets, transnational legality prefers to draw on the normative ideas of comparative advantage, consumer freedom, and the rule of law. These discursive strategies prove an unstable basis for legitimation without the critical supports provided by national states in gaining and maintaining the consent of local publics. As the findings of a recent international arbitration panel indicate (CMS v. Argentina), transnational legality prefers to view the local as a threat to the maintenance of its political-economic order, one of open borders free of rent-seeking public regulation. This will be the case even when states, like Argentina, take measures to mitigate the hardships of a severe economic downturn. Some critical theorists, like Hardt & Negri in Empire, similarly relegate the local to a marginal place without appreciating its contradictory but sustaining role in globalization's future. Such theoretical interventions, operating in conjunction with the disciplining effects of globalization's legal order, help to immobilize, rather than empower, resistance to the monocultures of transnational legality. The question remains whether the shaky foundations upon which the legitimacy of transnational legality are structured will prove less durable than its immobilizing effects.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.110023,12-Dec-06,Vol. 2,387-408 ,

364,Coming of Age: Law and Society Enters an Exclusive Club, Lawrence M. Friedman,"▪ Abstract Law and society, though not a field in itself, is the object of a growing movement that studies legal systems using tools of social science. Founded by sociologists, the movement now includes representatives of all the social sciences. It has developed strong organizations in the United States and in a number of other countries. Its adherents share a number of basic assumptions; they reject extreme ideas of legal autonomy and stress instead the dependence of law on its social context. Key components of the legal order, and thus key objects of study, are substance, procedures, structures, and legal culture. Scholars focus on the actual forces that produce law and on the impact of legal interventions. Sanctions, the peer group, and the internal moral sense are among the factors that determine actual impact. Much has been accomplished in the field, although much remains to be done, and translating findings into policy is often quite problematic.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115951,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,1-16,
365,The Comparative Study of Criminal Punishment, James Q. Whitman,"▪ Abstract This article reviews some of the literature on comparative criminal punishment and suggests possible directions for future research. It focuses on four topics. First is the sociology of modernity found in such authors as Foucault, Durkheim, Garland, Feeley and Simon, and others. While studies of modernity tend to downplay differences in modern societies, the work of these sociologists offer many starting points for valuable research. Second, the article discusses possible approaches to explaining differing degrees of harshness in criminal punishment. Third, the article surveys some of the approaches to the problem of explaining differing rates of violence in different cultures. Fourth, it explores some issues in the intersection between comparative criminal law and the comparative sociology of punishment. The article is intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115833,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,17-34 ,
366,ECONOMIC THEORIES OF SETTLEMENT BARGAINING, Andrew F. Daughety and  Jennifer F. Reinganum,"▪ Abstract We briefly review two basic models of settlement bargaining based on concepts from information economics and game theory. We then discuss how these models have been generalized to address issues that arise when there are more than two litigants with related cases. Linkages between cases can arise because of exogenous factors such as correlated culpability or damages, or they can be generated by discretionary choices on the part of the litigants themselves or by legal doctrine and rules of procedure.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115856,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,35-59 ,
367,LAW AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, Neil Fligstein and  Jennifer Choo,"▪ Abstract Corporate governance concerns three sets of issues: property rights, relationships between firms and financial markets, and labor relations. Our literature review shows that the system of corporate governance that emerges within a particular country reflects the outcome of political, social, and economic struggles in that country and that it does not reflect efficiency considerations focused on managing agency relations between owners and managers. Despite these facts, much research has been done in recent years attempting to analyze whether a superior matrix of institutional arrangements or a set of best practices of corporate governance exists to produce greater economic growth. Our review shows that there does not appear to be a single set of best practices, but rather that what is important are stable institutions that are legitimate and prevent extreme rent seeking on the part of governments and capitalists.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115944,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,61-84 ,
368,TRANSNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS: Exploring the Persistence and Globalization of Human Rights, Heinz Klug,"▪ Abstract This review considers how a socio-legal approach may be used to explore the relationship between human rights and law in the new century. Drawing on the classic traditions of law and society research, including gap studies, rights consciousness, public interest lawyering, and legal resource mobilization, as well as more recent approaches to legal globalization and epistemic communities or nongovernment networks, this paper begins to define a field of transnational human rights. The review traces the idea of transnational human rights to the struggles between social movements, in national and international fora, and the impact these struggles have had on the relationship between state power or sovereignty and the quest for legitimate and effective forms of governance. A key element of this endeavor, the paper concludes, is the need to integrate and understand the interaction between three traditionally separate domains of rights: international human rights, humanitarian law, and constitutional rights. It is this focus that defines the emerging field of transnational human rights.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115903,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,85-103 ,
369,EXPERT EVIDENCE AFTER DAUBERT, Michael J. Saks and  David L. Faigman,"▪ Abstract Daubert stands for a trilogy of Supreme Court cases as well as revisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Together they represent American law's most recent effort to filter expert evidence offered at trial. This review begins by placing the Daubert trilogy in the context of earlier judicial efforts to solve the screening problem, which began well before the twentieth century, and then provides a brief explication of evidence law under Daubert. Next, we discuss several aspects of the jurisprudence of expert evidence: its connection to debates in the philosophy of science, the practical legal problems courts are trying to solve, and procedural implications. Then we review and discuss varied impacts of Daubert: changes in law, marked increases in cases and scholarship relating to expert evidence, and research examining judicial gatekeeping under Daubert (civil defendants appear to benefit greatly and criminal defendants hardly at all). We conclude by offering several predictions and prescriptions for the future of expert evidence.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115907,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,105-130 ,
370,PLEA BARGAINING AND THE ECLIPSE OF THE JURY, Bruce P. Smith,"▪ Abstract The right to criminal jury trial is protected by the U.S. Constitution and the constitutions of all 50 states. In practice, however, roughly 95% of persons convicted of felonies in America waive their right to trial by jury by entering guilty pleas. Most such pleas derive from plea bargaining, whereby defendants plead guilty in exchange for prosecutorial and judicial concessions. Although plea bargaining has generated an extensive scholarly literature, its history, until recently, has remained obscure. This review examines existing legal-historical scholarship on the origins and expansion of plea bargaining in the nineteenth century and explores the range of factors cited by legal historians for plea bargaining's rise. It reveals that plea bargaining was one of several methods employed by Anglo-American criminal justice administrators to dispose of criminal cases without juries. When compared with these other modes of bypassing trial by jury, plea bargaining appears less distinctive—and less distinctively American—than often considered.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115948,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,131-149 ,
371,THE DEATH PENALTY MEETS SOCIAL SCIENCE: Deterrence and Jury Behavior Under New Scrutiny, Robert Weisberg,"▪ Abstract Social science has long played a role in examining the efficacy and fairness of the death penalty. Empirical studies of the deterrent effect of capital punishment were cited by the Supreme Court in its landmark cases in the 1970s; most notable was the 1975 Isaac Ehrlich study, which used multivariate regression analysis and purported to show a significant marginal deterrent effect over life imprisonment, but which was soon roundly criticized for methodological flaws. Decades later, new econometric studies have emerged, using panel data techniques, that report striking findings of marginal deterrence, even up to 18 lives saved per execution. Yet the cycle of debate continues, as these new studies face criticism for omitting key potential variables and for the potential distorting effect of one anomalously high-executing state (Texas). Meanwhile, other empiricists, relying mainly on survey questionnaires, have taken a fresh look at the human dynamics of death penalty trials, especially the attitudes and personal background factors that influence capital jurors.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.051804.082336,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,151-170 ,
372,"VOICE, CONTROL, AND BELONGING: The Double-Edged Sword of Procedural Fairness", Robert J. MacCoun,"▪ Abstract The procedural justice literature has grown enormously since the early work of Thibaut and Walker in the 1970s. Since then, the finding that citizens care enormously about the process by which outcomes are reached—even unfavorable outcomes—has been replicated a wide range of methodologies (including panel surveys, psychometric work, and experimentation), cultures (throughout North America, Europe, and Asia), and settings (including tort litigation, policing, taxpayer compliance, support for public policies, and organizational citizenship). We have learned a great deal about the antecedents and consequences of these judgments. In particular, the work of Tom Tyler and Allan Lind and their colleagues suggests that people care about voice, dignity, and respect for relational and symbolic reasons rather than (or in addition to) instrumental reasons. This finding has benevolent implications for governance and social cooperation, but also some troubling implications, leaving people susceptible to manipulation and exploitation.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115958,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,171-201 ,

Lucas and  Marcel Paret,"▪ Abstract After describing many of the features that structure educational opportunity, and how race interacts with these structures, we briefly relate a set of important orienting perspectives on the law-race relation. We divide issues of education into three categories: (a) inherently racialized aspects of law and education; (b) aspects of education that intersect race and the law; and (c) emerging issues in race, education, and the law. Treating desegregation, affirmative action, special education, gifted and talented education, tracking, high-stakes accountability, school finance, bilingual education, and legacy admissions, we identify key cases and controversies while critically evaluating relevant social science research. We close with a discussion of the law-race relation as revealed through its operation in the field of education.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115931,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,203-231 ,
374,LAW FACTS, Arthur L. Stinchcombe,"▪ Abstract This review article is not dedicated to a subject matter of research. Instead it outlines various kinds of facts commonly used to analyze the relations of law and society. To illustrate, it gives examples of eight distinct kinds of facts on how action departs from relevant laws on the books: actions in crusades; actions following deep norms when coordination norms are in conflict with them; police culture undermining legal citizen protection; corruption; legal pluralism as in colonies; crucial missing facts on behavior deliberately left out of the law of contract and similar laws to create flexibility; and disagreements between public opinion and the law. Each of these and more are then analyzed in terms of what is distinctive about them and of the kind of law and society theories they bear on.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115843,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,233-254 ,
375,REAL JURIES, Shari Seidman Diamond and  Mary R. Rose,"▪ Abstract The elaborate efforts of the legal system to control and channel jury behavior reveal a mistrust of an institution that also attracts extravagant praise. We look at the jury by examining research on real juries drawn from archival studies and post-trial surveys and interviews, as well as from the deliberations of real juries. We show how the methods used by courts to gather and select jurors affect the representativeness and legitimacy of the jury. We also examine the evidence underlying skepticism about jury verdicts and decision making, focusing on cases that pose special challenges to jurors, particularly those involving complex evidence, legal complexity, and the death penalty. We then consider how optimal jury trials can be achieved.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.120002,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,255-284 ,
376,"FEMINISM, FAIRNESS, AND WELFARE: An Invitation to Feminist Law and Economics", Gillian K. Hadfield,"▪ Abstract In recent years there has been a renewed effort to ground conventional law and economics methodology, with its exclusive focus on efficiency and income redistribution through the tax system, in modern welfare economics (Kaplow & Shavell 1994, 2001). This effort raises a challenge to the possibility of a feminist law and economics: Is it possible to be a good (welfare) economist and still maintain the ethical and political commitments necessary to address feminist concerns with, for example, rights, inequality, and caring labor? In this review, I argue that modern welfare economics, rather than supporting the ethical minimalism of conventional methodology advocated by Kaplow and Shavell, ratifies the need for an ethically and politically informed economic analysis. Feminists can, and should, use the tools of both positive and normative economics to analyze feminist issues in law.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115915,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,285-306 ,
377,CRIMINAL DISENFRANCHISEMENT," Christopher Uggen,  Angela Behrens, and  Jeff Manza","▪ Abstract Felon disenfranchisement has recently emerged as an issue of intense public concern and scholarly interest. This review highlights the broad range of socio-legal issues implicated by the practice of denying convicted felons the right to vote by considering the history, impact, and contemporary legal and scholarly debates surrounding the practice. Although race-neutral on their face, many U.S. laws stem from a history of racial discrimination and serve as an example of advantaged groups using the law as a mechanism to control disadvantaged groups. The practice of disenfranchising criminals has survived numerous legal challenges, raising questions about the fundamental nature of the right to vote in the United States and the representativeness of a democracy that systematically excludes a large group of citizens.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115840,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,307-322 ,
378,AFTER LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS, Susan S. Silbey,"▪ Abstract Legal consciousness as a theoretical concept and topic of empirical research developed to address issues of legal hegemony, particularly how the law sustains its institutional power despite a persistent gap between the law on the books and the law in action. Why do people acquiesce to a legal system that, despite its promises of equal treatment, systematically reproduces inequality? Recent studies have both broadened and narrowed the concept's reach, while sacrificing much of the concept's critical edge and theoretical utility. Rather than explaining how the different experiences of law become synthesized into a set of circulating schemas and habits, the literature tracks what particular individuals think and do. Because the relationships among consciousness and processes of ideology and hegemony often go unexplained, legal consciousness as an analytic concept is domesticated within what appear to be policy projects: making specific laws work better for particular groups or interests.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.115938,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,323-368 ,

Williamson,"▪ Abstract This review shows that a combined law, economics, and organization theory approach leads to different and deeper understandings of the purposes served by complex contract and economic organization. The business firm for these purposes is described not in technological terms (as a production function) but in organizational terms (as an alternative mode of governance). Firm and market are thus examined comparatively with respect to their capacities to organize transactions, which differ in their complexity, so as to economize on transaction costs. The predictive theory of economic organization that results has numerous ramifications for public policy toward business and for teaching and research in the law schools.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.031805.111122,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,369-396 ,
380,REVERSAL OF FORTUNE: The Resurgence of Individual Risk Assessment in Criminal Justice, Jonathan Simon,"▪ Abstract During the 1970s, the enterprise of individual risk assessment in the criminal justice system came under sharp attack from a number of angles, including legal, political, and empirical. A particularly acute site of this controversy was the use of psychological expertise to make individual risk assessments of persons with mental illness who found themselves within the criminal justice system. Successful court challenges to the procedures under which such persons were held in custody as dangerous were followed by empirical research on those persons released. The result was something of a paradigm crisis in the use of individual risk assessment in criminal justice and growing calls for its abandonment. By the 1990s, however, risk assessment was becoming more important than ever to the criminal justice system. This resurgence reflected the political demand for strategies to prevent violent crime and led to significant investments in research and policy development. In the new paradigm of risk assessment, psychological expertise is still valuable but mediated by actuarial and quasi-actuarial methods of identifying the dangerous.",Annual Review of Law and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.1.041604.120006,9-Dec-05,Vol. 1,397-421 ,
