0,Transnational Litigation in U.S. Courts: A Theoretical and Empirical Reassessment,Christopher A. Whytock,"It is widely claimed that the level of transnational litigation in U.S. courts is high and increasing, primarily due to forum shopping by foreign plaintiffs. This “transnational forum shopping claim” reflects the conventional wisdom among transnational litigation scholars. Lawyers use the claim in briefs; judges use it in court opinions; and interest groups use it to promote law reform. This article reassesses the transnational forum shopping claim theoretically and empirically. It argues that despite globalization, there are reasons to doubt the claim. Changes in procedural and substantive law have made the U.S. legal system less attractive to plaintiffs than it supposedly once was. Meanwhile, other legal systems have been adopting features similar to those that are said to have made the United States a “magnet forum” for foreign plaintiffs, and arbitration is growing as an alternative to transnational litigation. Empirically, using data on approximately 8 million civil actions filed in the U.S. district courts since 1988, the article shows that transnational diversity cases represent only a small portion of overall litigation, their level has decreased overall, and U.S., not foreign, plaintiffs file most of them. The data also reveal that federal question filings by foreign resident plaintiffs are not extensive or increasing either. These findings challenge the transnational forum shopping claim and law reforms based on it, and suggest that it should no longer be used by lawyers, judges, and scholars—at least not without supporting data. The article’s analysis also suggests new directions for transnational litigation as a field of scholarship that would move it beyond its current focus on U.S. courts toward a focus on understanding the dynamics of transnational litigation in global context.",03 February 2022,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Early View,NA,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12306
1,Does Group Familiarity Improve Deliberations in Judicial Teams? Evidence from the German Federal Court of Justice,Tilko Swalve,"Collegiality plays a central role in judicial decision-making. However, we still lack empirical evidence about the effects of collegiality on judicial decision-making. In this article, I argue familiarity, an antecedent to collegiality, improves judicial deliberations by encouraging minority dissent and a more extensive debate of different legal viewpoints. Relying on a novel dataset of 21,613 appeals in criminal cases at the German Federal Court of Justice between 1990 and 2016, I exploit quasi-random assignment of cases to decision-making groups to show that judges' pairwise familiarity substantially increases the probability that judges schedule a main hearing after first-stage deliberations. Group familiarity also increases the length of the justification of the ruling. The findings have implications for the way courts organize the assignment of judges to panels.",03 February 2022,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Early View,NA,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12308
2,Do Firearm Markets Comply with Firearm Restrictions? How the Massachusetts Assault Weapons Ban Enforcement Notice Changed Registered Firearm Sales,"Kenneth C. Wilbur, Meenakshi Balakrishna","How well do firearm markets comply with firearm restrictions? The Massachusetts Attorney General issued an Enforcement Notice in 2016 to announce a new interpretation of the key phrase “copies and duplicates” in the state's assault weapons ban. The Enforcement Notice increased assault rifle sales by 1349 (+560%) within 5 days, followed by a reduction of 211 (−58%) over the next 3 weeks. Assault rifle sales were 64%–66% lower in 2017 than in comparable earlier periods, suggesting that the Enforcement Notice reduced assault weapon sales but also that many banned weapons continued to be sold.",27 January 2022,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Early View,NA,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12307
3,Leases as Forms,"David A. Hoffman, Anton Strezhnev","We offer the first large-scale descriptive study of residential leases, based on a novel dataset of ~170,000 residential leases filed in support of over ~200,000 Philadelphia eviction proceedings from 2005 through 2019. These leases are highly likely to contain unenforceable terms, and their pro-landlord tilt has increased sharply over time. Matching leases with individual tenant characteristics, and to 16,261 unique owner-landlords, we show that unenforceable terms are likely to be associated with more expensive leaseholds in richer, whiter parts of the city. This result is linked to particular landlords' growing adoption of shared forms, originally created by nonprofit landlord associations, and more recently available online for a nominal fee. Generally, such shared form leases contain worse rules for tenants than the proprietary leases they replace. Over time, it has become easier and cheaper for landlords to adopt such common forms, meaning that access to justice for landlords strips tenants of rights.",23 January 2022,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Early View,NA,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12309
4,Citations to Interest Groups and Acceptance of Supreme Court Decisions,Kayla S. Canelo,"Interest groups have become increasingly involved in every aspect of American politics, including at the U.S. Supreme Court, with the filing of amicus curiae briefs. In recent years, the justices have been more frequently citing interest-group-filed briefs in their opinions, suggesting these groups play some role in the decision-making process. What we do not know is whether these types of citations might carry any potential implications for public perceptions of the Court's decisions as this phenomenon becomes more prevalent and people become equipped with this information. To test this empirically, I implement a survey experiment with approximately 3000 respondents that assesses acceptance of Supreme Court opinions that cite interest-group-filed amicus curiae briefs. I find that the public is less accepting of decisions that cite ideologically overt interests in the aggregate and less accepting of decisions that cite interest groups that are ideologically incompatible with their own preferences. However, the public does not view Supreme Court decision making as political, even when the justices cite ideologically charged groups. Taken together, these findings suggest the public uses interest group source cues to evaluate Supreme Court decisions when equipped with this information and that while the public responds negatively to politics in Supreme Court decisions, the Court maintains its image as a nonpolitical entity.",19 January 2022,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Early View,NA,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12304

6,The Effectiveness of Certificates of Relief: A Correspondence Audit of Hiring Outcomes,"Peter Leasure, Robert J. Kaminski","Although there are several collateral consequence relief mechanisms that could theoretically be used to improve employment outcomes for those with criminal history, many of these mechanisms are available only for first-time/low-level individuals or possess other requirements that limit their accessibility. Recognizing these facts, some jurisdictions have created certificates of relief, which are generally more accessible than other relief mechanisms. The goal of the current study was to test whether one state's (Ohio) certificate could improve hiring outcomes for men with criminal histories comprised of felony theft, felony drug possession, and misdemeanor drug paraphernalia convictions. This goal was achieved with the use of two field experiments. Results showed that certificate holders with criminal history received significantly fewer callbacks than those with no criminal record and fared no better than those with an identical criminal record and no certificate. Further, African-American applicants received significantly fewer callbacks than white applicants in all criminal record categories.",14 December 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 4", 849-875,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12297
7,Does the Bar Exam Protect the Public?,Kyle Rozema,"I study the effects of requiring lawyers to pass the bar exam on whether they are later publicly disciplined for misconduct. In the 1980s, by abolishing what is known as a diploma privilege, four states began to require graduates from all law schools to pass the bar exam. My research design exploits these events to estimate the effect of the bar passage requirement on the share of lawyers publicly sanctioned by state discipline bodies. I find that during the first decade of their careers lawyers licensed without a bar passage requirement are publicly sanctioned at similar rates to lawyers licensed after passing a bar exam. Small differences do begin to emerge after a decade, however, and larger though still modest differences form after two decades.",14 December 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 4", 801-848,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12299
8,Understanding the Decline in Drinking and Driving During “The Other Great Moderation”,Darren Grant,"This article seeks to explain the large decline in drinking and driving that occurred in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s. Using a simple measure of drinking and driving—the fraction of crashes involving drinking drivers—we develop a basic traffic safety model that improves estimates of drunk driving laws' effects and breaks down declines in drinking and driving into components associated with each major influence that has been identified in the literature—including unobservable “social forces.” In this decomposition, we find that the widespread enactment of seven major drunk driving laws explains only one-fifth of the reduction in drinking and driving over this period, comparable to the effects of reduced alcohol consumption and less than those of demographic shifts and changes in social attitudes. “The Other Great Moderation” is best understood as a two-decade movement of drinking and driving to a new steady state, led by social forces and cemented and extended by law.",17 November 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 4", 876-907,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12300
9,Assessing the Influence of Amici on Supreme Court Decision Making,"Ronald Mann, Michael Fronk","The authors analyze a dataset of indicators of the influence of amicus filings on the decisions of the United States Supreme Court from October Term 2013 through October Term 2018), examining the effect of filings on the prevailing party, on citations to amicus filings, and on sources drawn from amicus filings. The dataset includes 386 cases, 4500 amicus filings, and 22,000 citations in Supreme Court decisions. In some ways, the paper updates scholarship from the turn of the century, when amicus filings were much less prevalent, but it also breaks new ground with the data about citations to amicus filings and sources drawn from amicus filings.",29 October 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 4", 700-741,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12302
10,The Canada Trademarks Dataset,Jeremy N. Sheff,"This article discloses and describes a new research dataset representing the Canadian Intellectual Property Office's historical archive of trademark applications. This individual-application-level dataset includes all applications since approximately 1980, and many preserved applications and registrations dating back to the beginning of Canada's trademark registry in 1865, totaling over 1.6 million application records. It includes comprehensive bibliographic and lifecycle data; trademark characteristics; goods and services claims; identification of applicants, attorneys, and other interested parties (including address data); detailed prosecution history event data; and data on application, registration, and use claims in countries other than Canada. Both the dataset and the code used to build and analyze it are presented for public use on open-access terms at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4999655. This article uses the dataset to generate novel descriptive analyses of the performance of Canada's trademark registration system and the behavior of applicants for registration, both independently and in comparison to the United States and Australia. These analyses suggest that Canada's trademark registration system is substantially underperforming other nations with respect to efficiency of examination, and that recent statutory and regulatory changes in Canadian trademark law may have the effect of masking or even exacerbating this underperformance while decreasing the reliability of the Canadian trademark registry as an authoritative guide to trademarks used in Canadian commerce.",29 October 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 4", 908-955,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12303
11,The Dogma Within? Examining Religious Bias in Private Title VII Claims,"Matthew Dahl, Devan N. Patel, Matthew E. K. Hall","In recent years, American politicians have become increasingly concerned that judges who identify as Christian are making decisions based on that identity—that Christian judges harbor a certain “dogma” within them that shapes their decision making. In this article, we investigate whether this concern is warranted by examining how such judges handle claims that are brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits private discrimination in employment on the basis of religion. By focusing on decision making in cases of private discrimination—rather than public discrimination—we make progress on a theoretical conundrum that has dogged previous efforts to identify causal effects in religious accommodation cases. However, our tests produce little evidence to support the idea that Christian judges are more likely than their non-Christian colleagues to favor claimants, even in this alternative domain. Our findings therefore suggest that the current political focus on possible bias among Christian judges is empirically unfounded, at least in situations of religious accommodation.",27 October 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 4", 742-764,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12298
12,Prosecution or Persecution? Extraneous Events and Prosecutorial Decisions,"Samantha Bielen, Peter Grajzl","In 2004, a Dutch-Moroccan Islamic extremist in Amsterdam brutally murdered Theo van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker known for his critique of Islam. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we show that, in Amsterdam, the assassination resulted in more than a 19-percentage-point increase in the likelihood of prosecution for unrelated violent crimes of male suspects born in Muslim-majority countries. The effect is detectable during the first month following the murder but dissipates thereafter. We find no evidence of the murder's effect for nonviolent crimes and for violent crimes processed by other Dutch prosecution offices. Our findings are thus not consistent with a purely emotions-based explanation of the murder's effect. Instead, our results are congruent with both a signaling explanation, whereby career-motivated prosecutors chose to showcase their toughness, and a behavioral explanation entailing prosecutors' susceptibility to availability heuristic bias. On institutional grounds, we view the latter as more plausible than the former. Our article adds to an emerging literature demonstrating that extraneous events can critically shape criminal justice outcomes.",20 October 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 4", 765-800,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12301

14,Consumption Tax Reform and the Real Economy: Evidence From India's Adoption of a Value-Added Tax,"Abhay Aneja, Nirupama Kulkarni, S. K. Ritadhi","We study the impact of a consumption tax reform on firm capital and productivity by examining India's replacement of the sales tax with a value-added tax (VAT). Unlike the sales tax, the VAT allowed firms to offset their tax liability with VAT paid on capital inputs, effectively reducing the tax-related cost of capital. Exploiting the staggered adoption of the tax reform across Indian states, we show that VAT adoption increased firm capital by 3%. The effects are driven by financially-constrained firms – an important source of heterogeneity in a developing country context. We also document a corresponding improvement in the productivity of financially-constrained firms. Our findings thus suggest that beyond revenue generation, consumption tax reforms can have the additional effect of stimulating investment and productivity in resource-constrained environments.",20 September 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 3", 569-602,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12296
15,"Ideology, Disadvantage, and Federal District Court Inmate Civil Rights Filings: The Troubling Effects of Pro Se Status",Anna Gunderson,"Nearly 80 percent of all federal judicial activity occurs in the district courts and a significant portion of that activity is the result of prisoners filing petitions against state and federal correctional representatives. We know relatively little about these lawsuits, however. This article focuses on inmate civil rights filings as a vital form of political action of those incarcerated and argues that ideology and disadvantage play a role in the ultimate outcome of these cases. I amass a large dataset of every prison condition or civil rights petition filed by an inmate from 1989 to 2016 and find that while ideology does not predict the likelihood an inmate lawsuit will succeed, that prisoners' pro se status, whether they file the petition without the aid of an attorney, makes it significantly more likely the suit will be dismissed and less likely that inmate will receive relief. This is suggestive evidence that pro se status, and not necessarily actual legal quality, may be driving outcomes in prisoners' rights cases. This article has implications not only for the study of judicial decision making in the federal district courts, but also as an example of important political action of a disenfranchised and neglected group in our legal system.",13 September 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 3", 603-628,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12290
16,Death Penalty Statutes and Murder Rates: Evidence From Synthetic Controls,Brett Parker,"Public debates over the death penalty in the U.S. have long focused on the punishment's putative deterrent effect. Unsurprisingly, numerous scholars have sought to determine (1) whether the penalty in fact prevents murders, and (2) how many murders it prevents. However, these efforts have deployed a fairly homogeneous set of methodological techniques—primarily OLS and two-stage least squares with instrumental variables. This article breaks from that tradition by using synthetic controls to assess the deterrent capacity of capital punishment. Applying this technique using seven states that recently abolished the death penalty and 29 states that retained the punishment during the same period, I find no evidence that the presence of a capital punishment statute in a state is sufficient to deter murders. These results are robust to numerous alternative specifications; they also persist when I use stranger homicides—which are theoretically more susceptible to deterrence—as the dependent variable.",13 September 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 3", 488-533,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12291
17,Physician Licensing and Discipline: Lessons From Indiana,"Jing Liu, David A. Hyman","Using physician licensing data from 1972–2015 obtained from Indiana, we examine the performance of the disciplinary process in enforcing minimum performance standards. Only 1.2 percent of the physicians in our dataset were disciplined. Drug diversion, substance abuse, and sexual misconduct account for 60 percent of all disciplinary actions. Male physicians are at higher risk for disciplinary action for sexual misconduct and drug diversion, but not for other types of misconduct. Graduates of U.S. and non-U.S. medical schools have the same overall risk of disciplinary action—but for non-U.S. educated physicians, this is the result of averaging a significantly lower risk of discipline for drug and alcohol abuse and drug diversion with a significantly higher risk of discipline for negligence and sexual misconduct. Physicians who attended medical school in the Caribbean have a significantly higher risk of discipline for negligence/incompetence, but not for other causes.",13 September 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 3", 629-659,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12292
18,The Impact of Employers' Liability on 19th-Century U.K. Coalmining Fatalities,Cento Veljanovski,The effects of the increase in the employers' liability on work accidents is underresearched. This article investigates the impact using time series analysis of changes brought about by the Employers' Liability Act 1880 and Workmens' Compensation Act 1897 on the U.K. coal mining fatality rates and wages over the period 1873 to 1914. The statistical analysis finds little evidence that these reforms affected coal mining fatality rates. There is some statistical evidence that this may have been due to offsetting wage adjustments as the employers were required to compensate those injured and the survivors of deceased miners.,13 September 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 3", 660-683,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12293

Boyea, Paul Brace","In this research note, we extend four decades of research mapping the work of state supreme courts since the 1870s employing newly available data to map the work of state high courts into the 21st century. Comparing these recent data with the historical patterns illustrated in past studies, our analysis reveals both stable trends as well as notable changes. Criminal and contract appeals continued to increase, debt and real property appeals continued to decrease, tort appeals stabilized, and public law and family and estates appeals declined markedly in the most recent period after exhibiting stability previously. Combined with these past studies, this research note illustrates both significant stability as well as notable change in the work of state supreme court dockets spanning almost 150 years.",13 September 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 3", 684-696,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12294
20,The Federal Enforcement Threat: The Effect of Overfiling Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,Caroline Cecot,"States and the federal government typically share responsibility for environmental enforcement, with many states acquiring primary authority to enforce federal law. Under most federal environmental statutes, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) retains the right to “overfile,” or file its own enforcement action against a violator in addition to a state enforcement action. This article empirically tests the effect of EPA's ability to overfile on the state's enforcement strategy in the context of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In Harmon Industries v. Browner, 191 F.3d 894 (8th Cir., 1999 the Harmon decision), the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the EPA does not have the authority to overfile under RCRA. Other circuits, particularly the 10th Circuit, have disagreed with the Eighth Circuit's conclusion, holding that the EPA retains such authority, and the Supreme Court has never resolved this issue. This article predicts that states within the Eighth Circuit with preferences for lower environmental enforcement would impose more lenient penalties after the Harmon decision, and it tests this prediction using several proxies for state environmental enforcement preferences. I find that states in the Eighth Circuit with Republican governors were more likely to lower the final penalty amount from the proposed penalty amount after the Harmon decision. In other estimations, I also find that states in the Eighth Circuit with Republican governors collected less, on average, in final penalty amount per enforcement action after the Harmon decision. Other proxies for lower enforcement preferences, however, were not associated with consistent statistically significant effects. Because the governor arguably has the strongest influence on state enforcement policy, the results provide some support for the model's preference-based predictions. Overall, the results suggest that the existence of a specific and relatively infrequent type of federal enforcement action—EPA's ability to overfile—could have a substantial effect on overall environmental enforcement through its ability to affect the enforcement efforts of certain states. These findings shed light on how federal enforcement efforts might matter in the context of cooperative federalism.",13 September 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 3", 534-568,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12295

22,The Effect of Board Structure on Firm Disclosure and Behavior: A Case Study of Korea and a Comparison of Research Designs,"Bernard Black, Woochan Kim, Julia Nasev","We exploit a large legal shock to the board structure of Korean firms, using a strong research design—combined difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity—to study whether this board structure change affects firm financial reporting (disclosure, MD&A length, and abnormal accruals), investment and growth (sales growth and capital expenditures), and firm value (proxied by Tobin's q). We also compare results from the annual DiD/RD design to those from simpler panel and “causal” methods, and assess how results vary across methods. We find robust evidence across methods that the shock predicts improved scores on a Disclosure Subindex, confirm prior findings of an increase in Tobin's q, and find some evidence for a drop in sales growth, but no convincing evidence of significant change for other outcomes. By comparing results across methods, we illustrate how using multiple causal designs can provide insight into and evidence of robustness not available from a single design, as well as case study evidence that panel methods, simple DiD, and its close cousin, shock-based IV, can produce apparent false positives.",25 June 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 2", 328-376,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12280
23,"Do People Like Mandatory Rules? The Choice Between Disclosures, Defaults, and Mandatory Rules in Supplier-Customer Relationships","Ori Katz, Eyal Zamir","In recent years, numerous empirical studies have examined the prevailing attitudes toward nudges, but hardly any have examined the prevailing attitudes toward mandatory rules. To fill this gap, this article describes five studies (N = 3,103)—mostly preregistered studies conducted with representative samples of the U.S. population—which tested people's attitudes toward mandatory rules in contractual settings. We found that in supplier-customer relationships, people tend to rate mandatory rules as more desirable than disclosure duties and default rules. People's judgments in this regard depend on the relative effectiveness of the various types of rules in protecting customer's interests and their expected impact on the price, but there is considerable support for mandatory rules even if they are only slightly or moderately more effective than the alternatives, and even when they entail some price increase. People tend to believe that mandatory rules in this sphere enhance customers' freedom of contract—which may explain why these judgments are not correlated with people's ideological inclinations (liberal or conservative).",25 June 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 2", 421-460,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12285
24,Is “Not Guilty” the Same as “Innocent”? Evidence from SEC Financial Fraud Investigations,"David H. Solomon, Eugene Soltes","When the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigates firms for financial fraud, investors learn about the investigation only if managers disclose it, or regulators sanction the firm. We investigate the effects of such disclosures using confidential records on all investigations, regardless of outcome. Even when no charges are brought, firms that voluntarily disclose an investigation underperform non-disclosing firms by 11.7 percent over the following year. Disclosure is associated with a higher chance of shareholder class action lawsuits, and more prominent disclosures are associated with worse returns. CEOs who disclose an investigation are 14 percent more likely to experience turnover.

25,Who Votes Without Identification? Using Individual-Level Administrative Data to Measure the Burden of Strict Voter Identification Laws,"Phoebe Henninger, Marc Meredith, Michael Morse","Legal disputes over laws that require certain forms of identification (ID) to vote mostly focus on the burden placed on people who do not possess ID. We contend that this singular focus ignores the burden imposed on people who do possess ID, but nonetheless cannot access it when voting. To measure this alternative conception of burden, we focus on Michigan, which allows anyone who lacks access to ID to vote after signing an affidavit. A sample of affidavits filed in the 2016 presidential election from a random set of precincts reveals that about 0.45 percent of voters lacked access to ID. Consistent with our broader conception of the burden of voter ID laws, nearly all voters who filed an affidavit were previously issued a still-active state ID. Importantly, we show minority voters were about five times more likely to lack access to ID than white voters. We also present survey evidence suggesting that people who live in states where voters are asked to show ID, as in Michigan, are more likely to incorrectly believe that access to ID is required to vote than are people who live in states that do not ask voters to show ID.",07 June 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 2", 256-286,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12283

Yet, little empirical research has been conducted on the determinants of LWOP sentences. The dearth of research on LWOP sentencing stands in sharp contrast to the many dozens of studies that have been conducted on the determinants of death sentences–studies that have consistently found that race, gender, and other questionable factors may influence sentencing outcomes.

27,Affirming the District Judge: An Empirical Analysis of the Effect of District Judges Sitting by Designation on Circuit Court Panels,"Andrew Sayer, Melanie Hess, Matthew E. K. Hall","Ten of the 12 U.S. courts of appeals regularly invite district court judges to take part in appellate decisions. This practice, known as “sitting by designation,” has received mixed reviews from judges and scholars. Some argue that the practice undermines democratic legitimacy and collegiality on the courts of appeals. Others contend that district court judges sitting by designation have little effect on the process because they are deferential—perhaps far too deferential—toward their circuit court brethren. Despite this ongoing debate, few studies have empirically analyzed the effects of judges sitting by designation on appellate court decision making. Here, we empirically assess whether panels that include a judge sitting by designation are more likely to affirm the district court decision. We hypothesize that judges sitting by designation are more likely to affirm district court decisions, and the panel effects associated with a judge sitting on a circuit panel will result in more “affirm” votes by circuit court judges sitting with those district court judges. Our analysis of 9,154 court of appeals decisions confirms that the presence of a judge sitting by designation does have a positive and statistically significant effect on the rate at which court of appeals judges vote to affirm district court decisions.",17 May 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 2", 461-484,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12284

We first show that the conventional predictions are less accurate than, and have similar rates of negative prediction error as, a simple Bayes classifier that makes use of only the base failure rate. Machine-learning algorithms based on the underlying risk assessment questionnaire do better under the assumption that negative prediction errors are more costly than positive prediction errors. Machine-learning models based on two-year criminal histories do even better. Indeed, adding the protocol-based features to the criminal histories adds little to the predictive adequacy of the model. We suggest using the predictions based on criminal histories to prioritize incoming calls for service, and devising a more sensitive instrument to distinguish true from false positives that result from this initial screening.",24 March 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 1", 90-130,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12276

To its critics, Alice renders important inventions in medical diagnostics, biotechnology, and information technology unpatenable and therefore discouraging investment in critical market sector innovation. To its defenders, Alice offers a reliable, quick, and cheap way to invalidate weak patents owned by patent trolls, reducing patent holdup and protecting innovators. In response to these debates, we explore how the courts actually use Alice. We construct a unique dataset of every district court and federal circuit decision on patentable subject matter from July 2014 through June 2019 and categorize the patent plaintiffs in each case using the Stanford NPE Litigation Database. Once in court, patentable subject matter challenges are far more common in software/IT cases, and biotech/life science innovations are more likely to survive. Surprisingly, the entities most likely to lose their patents are not patent trolls but individual inventors and inventor-started companies. Our findings have important implications for current legislative and judicial disputes over patent reform as some of the patent owners most impacted may be overlooked.",16 March 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 1", 47-89,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12275

34,Goldilocks Deference?,"Daniel H. Cole, Elizabeth Baldwin, Katie Meehan","Over the years, courts reviewing rules and decisions of federal administrative agencies have given those agencies greater or narrower latitude in interpreting enabling legislation, ranging from the “hard look” doctrine to various levels of deference under case names such as Chevron, Auer, and Skidmore. This article examines a distinct type of judicial deference that might arise only in a special subset of cases where an agency is sued by two different interested parties arguing diametrically opposed positions. For example, the EPA may be sued on a major, substantive rule by the regulated industry arguing that the rule is too restrictive and by environmental groups arguing that it is too lax. In such cases, we hypothesize that reviewing courts might exercise “Goldilocks deference,” based on the assumption that if environmental groups and regulated industries are dissatisfied, then the agency's rule must be just about right. Using an empirical dataset of 160 cases, we show that the EPA is more likely to prevail when it is sued by both sides, suggesting that the hypothesis of Goldilocks deference is at least plausible.",17 February 2021,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 18, Issue 1", 167-188,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12278

36,Manna from Heaven for Judges: Judges’ Reaction to a Quasi-Random Reduction in Caseload,"Christoph Engel, Keren Weinshall","What is the impact of caseload on judicial decision making? Is increasing judicial staff effective in improving judicial services? To address these questions, we exploit a natural, near-randomized experiment in the Israeli judiciary. In 2012, six senior registrars were appointed in two of the six magistrate's court districts. The choice of districts was motivated by reasons unrelated to judicial performance. In these two districts, the civil caseload per judge was substantially reduced. We find that the reduction had a significant impact on the process and outcomes of judicial decision making. Judges working in courts with reduced caseload invested more resources in resolving each case. The effect is mostly to the advantage of plaintiffs, who were more likely to win, recover a larger fraction of their claims, and be reimbursed for litigation costs. We discuss the implications for judicial management and theories about judicial decision making.",24 November 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 4", 722-751,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12265
37,Persistent Effects of Colonial Institutions on Long-Run Development: Local Evidence from Regression Discontinuity Design in Argentina,"Rok Spruk, Mitja Kovac","We exploit the discontinuity in the integration into the colonial court district of Real Audiencia in Upper Peru to estimate how colonial institutions have impacted local development across 527 departments in Argentina. Our identification strategy takes advantage of geo-referenced spatial boundary splits with local quasi-randomization between the localities integrated into the colonial court jurisdiction and the localities outside Audiencia's jurisdiction. The results show the impact of colonial institutions imposed by real audiencia in Upper Peru is both strong and remarkably persistent. Departments outside the colonial court district have lower literacy rates, a less computer-literate population, better physical and digital infrastructure, and more widespread computer ownership. The established effects of real audiencia do not seem driven by the climatic conditions and environment of disease, and are robust to a battery of specification checks, placebo tests, and falsification tests. We show that Audiencia's effect persisted through its influence on public goods provision, economic specialization patterns, clientelist networks, and elite control of the political representation.",24 November 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 4", 820-861,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12266
38,Responses to Liability Immunization: Evidence from Medical Devices,"Elissa P. Gentry, Benjamin J. McMichael","The Supreme Court's decision in Riegel v. Medtronic immunized medical device manufacturers from certain types of state product liability claims. However, this immunization applies only when the devices underlying those claims have been approved through the Food and Drug Administration's most rigorous—and costly—review process, premarket approval (PMA). Exploiting this decision, we examine whether manufacturers strategically respond to this new immunity. We find evidence that, following Riegel, approvals for high-risk product categories increase relative to the comparable change for low-risk categories, suggesting that firms are sensitive to the newly immunized risk. We additionally find evidence that physician treatment patterns with respect to medical devices also change, consistent with Riegel shifting liability away from device manufacturers and toward physicians. The analysis provides evidence that sophisticated actors respond to changes in their expected legal liability and that technical legal decisions have important ramifications for the provision of healthcare.",24 November 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 4", 789-819,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12268
39,A Nationalist Backlash to International Refugee Law: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Turkey,"Kevin L. Cope, Charles Crabtree","How do international laws affect citizens' willingness to accept refugees? In full and partial democracies, citizens' attitudes can influence national policy. A growing literature suggests that international institutions can influence citizens' attitudes on foreign policy issues, and therefore lead to policy change, but those studies are almost entirely confined to domestic human rights and U.S.-based respondents; none consider refugee policy. Using data from a survey experiment administered in September 2017 via face-to-face interviews with 1,335 citizens of Turkey, we investigate how international norms affect citizens' willingness to accept refugees. Our findings are surprising: reminding people about the government's responsibility under the Refugee Convention to accept refugees triggers a backfire effect, decreasing support for accepting them. This effect appears driven by respondents who support the incumbent AKP Party and by lower-educated respondents. We therefore provide evidence that international refugee law—and perhaps international institutions generally—can trigger a political backlash, undermining the very policies that they promote.",24 November 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 4", 752-788,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12269

41,Filibuster Change and Judicial Appointments,"Jonathan Remy Nash, Joanna Shepherd","In this article, we consider the effects of filibuster change on judicial appointments, judicial voting, and opinion drafting. The filibuster effectively empowers a minority of 41 senators by requiring 60 votes to break off debate on a nomination. We develop a game-theoretic model that explains that the elimination of the filibuster changed the relevant “pivotal senator,” whose support was necessary to secure a nomination. Freed of the power of the minority of senators, presidents ought to exercise freer rein in naming judicial nominees closer to their preferred ideology. Moreover, sitting judges who seek elevation to a higher court ought to alter their “signal” that they would be good candidates to match the preferences of the newly relevant pivotal senator. To test our hypotheses empirically, we use the 2013 elimination of the filibuster in the U.S. Senate for lower federal court judicial nominations as an exogenous shock. We explore how the change in the filibuster rule affected the characteristics of judges President Obama nominated to the federal courts. We find statistically significant shifts in the background characteristics of judges confirmed to the federal courts of appeals after the elimination of the filibuster. Compared to the earlier Obama appointees, these judges were more likely to be female, slightly younger, and to have previously clerked for a liberal judges, but less likely to be nonwhite. In addition, we find that there was a statistically significant increase in the confirmation of judges with liberal ideologies, as measured by their common space campaign finance scores. These liberal ideologies mapped onto actual votes in politically charged cases. Compared to Obama judges confirmed before the rule change, these judges were more likely to cast pro-choice votes in abortion cases and anti-death penalty votes in death penalty cases. We also find evidence that the elimination of the filibuster had a polarizing effect on sitting federal district judges, especially those with a greater chance of promotion to the courts of appeals. Using computational content analysis, we find that after the change in the filibuster rule, Democratic judges were more likely to use politically charged words signaling their very liberal ideological positions in abortion opinions and Republican judges were more likely to use words signaling their conservative views. These findings are useful in assessing the desirability of restoring the judicial filibuster, as well in assessing the debate over the retention of the legislative filibuster.",24 November 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 4", 646-695,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12271
42,Copyright and Economic Viability: Evidence from the Music Industry,"Kristelia García, James Hicks, Justin McCrary","Copyright provides a long term of legal excludability, ostensibly to encourage the production of new creative works. How long this term should last, and the extent to which current law aligns with the economic incentives of copyright owners, has been the subject of vigorous theoretical debate. We investigate the economic viability of content in a major content industry—commercial music—using a novel longitudinal dataset of weekly sales and streaming counts. We find that the typical sound recording has an extremely short commercial half-life—on the order of months, rather than years or decades—but also see evidence that subscription streaming services are extending this period of economic viability. Strikingly, though, we find that decay rates are sharp even for blockbuster songs, and that the patterns persist when we approximate weekly revenue. Although our results do not provide an estimate of the causal effect of copyright on incentives, they do put bounds on the problem, suggesting a misalignment between the economic realities of the music industry and the current life-plus-70 copyright term.",05 November 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 4", 696-721,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12267

44,ALL-CAPS,"Yonathan A. Arbel, Andrew Toler","A hallmark of consumer contracts is their use of long blocks of capitalized text. These “all-caps” clauses are meant to alert consumers to nonstandard, risky, or important aspects of the transaction that would otherwise be hidden in the fine print. Based on a belief in the power of all-caps, courts will often deny enforcement of many key terms—such as warranty disclaimers, liability releases, arbitration clauses, and automatic billing—unless they are presented in all-caps. This article is the first to empirically examine the effectiveness of all-caps. Using an experimental methodology, the article finds that all-caps fail to appreciably improve consent. Moreover, some evidence suggests that all-caps are harmful to older consumers. We collect evidence from standard form agreements used by the largest companies in the United States and find that, despite its limitations, three-quarters of consumer contracts contain at least one all-caps paragraph. Based on these findings and other evidence reported here, this article lays out the dangers and risks of continued reliance on all-caps and calls for abandoning all-caps.",02 November 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 4", 862-896,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12272

46,Factoring the Role of Eyewitness Evidence in the Courtroom,"Brandon L. Garrett, Alice Liu, Karen Kafadar, Joanne Yaffe, Chad S. Dodson","A pressing concern with the eyewitness testimony used in many criminal cases is that jurors may be swayed by the high confidence of an eyewitness and, as a result, may disregard other factors that provide more diagnostic information. Mock jurors were surveyed using a large national sample of 1,684 laypeople, selected to be representative of the U.S. population (age, race, gender, geographic region), using mock trial videos of eyewitness testimony. To explore the relationship between courtroom confidence and other factors, we used a fractional factorial design, permitting examination of the relationships among seven factors. Among these seven factors, we found that jurors gave most weight to the confidence of eyewitnesses, especially that expressed in the courtroom, irrespective of the eyewitness's testimony about confidence (low or high) at the initial police lineup. Jurors' assessments were not sensitive to the other factors or their interactions in the experiment: crime type (burglary or sexual assault), the race of the defendant and eyewitness, or information provided in judicial instructions or by expert testimony. The disproportionate importance of the eyewitness's expressed confidence has implications for the effectiveness of legal efforts to inform jurors about factors affecting eyewitness memory.",28 August 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 3", 556-579,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12259
47,"Judicial Disparity, Deviation, and Departures from Sentencing Guidelines: The Case of Hong Kong","Kevin Kwok-yin Cheng, Sayaka Ri, Natasha Pushkarna","Analyzing sentencing disparity calls for more calibrated measures to capture the nuances of judicial discretion within jurisdictions that adopt strict sentencing guidelines. This article uses an unconventional outcome variable, percent deviation, to investigate guideline digressions in a nested, multilevel model. Percent deviation is calculated based on the difference between the guidelines’ “arithmetic starting point” and the actual starting point that a judge adopts. Two equations were used to measure percent deviation from the arithmetic starting point before and after adjustment for guilty plea sentence reductions. Extracting data on drug trafficking cases from an open-source database from the Hong Kong Judiciary (n = 356), we illustrate how percent deviation can be employed as a measure of inter-judge disparity using hierarchical linear models (HLMs). Our findings suggest that approximately 8 to 10 percent of the deviation in sentence length can be attributed to judges’ differential sentencing behaviors. The deviation is affected by case characteristics as well as judicial characteristics. Due to the wide guideline ranges, departures from said guidelines’ ranges are not common. This indicates that the guideline ranges mask the deviation and inter-judge disparity that exist and recur.",28 August 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 3", 580-614,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12260

Pritchard","In this article, we study attorney fees awarded in the largest securities class actions: “mega-settlements.” Consistent with prior work, we find larger fee awards but lower percentages in these cases. We also find that courts are more likely to reject or modify fee requests made in connection with the largest settlements. We conjecture that this scrutiny provides an incentive for law firms to bill more hours, not to advance the case, but to help justify large fee awards—“make work.” The results of our empirical tests are consistent with plaintiffs’ attorneys investing more time in litigation against larger companies, with the largest potential damages, particularly when there are multiple lead counsel firms. We find a similar pattern with relative efficiency, with more hours per docket entry for the largest-stake cases with multiple lead counsel firms. Overall, our results suggest that plaintiffs’ attorneys are receiving windfall fee awards in at least some mega-settlement cases at shareholders’ expense.",28 August 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 3", 438-465,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12262

Sisk","The relationship between judicial inputs and outputs remains opaque. Conventional wisdom is plentiful but useful evidence is not. This study examines civil appeals in three federal appellate courts, concentrating on the briefing, the attorneys, and the complexity of the case. We find no evidence that short briefs are more persuasive, while the evidence in favor of long briefs on the appellant's side is provocative. We also find suggestive evidence that the experience of the lead lawyer on the appellee's side matters. However, “Big Law” firms and large teams of lawyers do not seem to perform better on appeal, all else equal. Finally, different kinds of case complexity point in different directions. The presence of a cross-appeal is associated with judge votes to reverse—but not necessarily in favor of the cross-appellant. At the same time, complex trial-level proceedings may be associated with judge votes to affirm.",28 August 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 3", 519-555,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12263
51,Mapping the Iceberg: The Impact of Data Sources on the Study of District Courts,"Christina L. Boyd, Pauline T. Kim, Margo Schlanger","Three decades ago, Siegelman and Donohue aptly characterized research about courts and litigation that relied only on published opinions as “studying the iceberg from its tip.” They implored researchers to view published district court opinions “with greater sensitivity to the ways in which such cases are unrepresentative of all cases”. The dynamic, multistage nature of trial court litigation makes a focus solely on published opinions particularly ill-suited to the study of federal district courts. Expanded electronic access to court documents now allows more precise analysis of the ways in which published cases are unrepresentative and what differences that makes for conclusions about the work of district courts. Heeding Siegelman and Donohue's admonition, this study seeks to map the iceberg, exploring the extent to which the visible part misrepresents what lies below the surface. Using a supplemented version of the Kim, Schlanger, and Martin EEOC Litigation Project data, this article examines the varying extent to which cases and judicial activity are visible in the several data sources commonly used by district court researchers. More specifically, we analyze how the work of federal district courts looks different depending on whether research relies on published opinions, on opinions available on Westlaw or Lexis (both “published” and “unpublished”), or on more comprehensive data available on PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Documents). Our results reveal vast variation in visibility of cases and motions, depending on the data source used. We also demonstrate that these differences in case and motion visibility can affect the results of empirical analyses relating to, for example, the success rates of litigants and whether the party of the appointing president affects judicial behavior. Our findings mean that utilizing docket sheets, now available electronically, to gather data will often be required to draw accurate conclusions about the nature of district court litigation and the behavior of district court judges.",28 August 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 3", 466-492,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12264
52,Economic Gender Equality and the Decline of Alimony in Switzerland,Dorian Kessler,"Research has established a historical decline of alimony for divorced women in Western countries. Because the main function of alimony is to compensate for differences in couples' economic resources and needs, it is plausible that the reduction of alimony is a consequence of greater economic equality between husbands and wives. Scholars of divorce law, however, have argued that declines in alimony have instead resulted from a deliberate reorientation of alimony law that, by limiting alimony, has sought to facilitate divorces and to cause greater economic gender equality. Through a trend decomposition analysis that draws on couple income data linked to case-level court reports from Switzerland before and after the introduction of no-fault divorce (1990–2008), this study assesses the extent to which the decline of alimony is a consequence of reduced economic inequality in couples. During the study period, alimony declined from about one divorce in two to about one divorce in three, but the explanatory value of lower economic inequality in couples is limited regarding this trend. In fact, greater shares of couples' incomes earned by women and more egalitarian distributions of child custody after divorce can explain, at best, half the decline in limited-term alimony. Greater equality in pension incomes explains steep reductions in unlimited alimony but cannot account for why limited-term alimony awards for women of working age have become less likely. I conclude that increases in Swiss women's economic self-sufficiency have not kept pace with the decline of alimony. The hypotheses that changing norms in alimony law are reducing alimony and that less alimony stimulates women's employment thus deserve closer examination.",14 August 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 3", 493-518,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12258

One such test case is the patent examination process, with numerous commentators arguing that scientific peer review can solve informational deficits in patent determinations. We present results from a novel randomized field experiment, carried out over the course of three years, in which 336 prominent scientific experts agreed to provide input on U.S. patent applications. Their input was edited for compliance with submission requirements and submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) by our research team. We show that the intervention caused examiners to (1) increase search efforts and citations to the non-patent (scientific) literature and (2) grant the application at lower rates in the first instance. However, results were substantially weaker and resource costs substantially higher than anticipated in the literature, highlighting significant challenges and questions of institutional design in bringing scientific expertise into law and government.",22 May 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 2", 190-223,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12249

Bartlett III, Justin McCrary","Using data from the 2016–2018 Tick Size Pilot Study, we examine the efficacy of using wider tick sizes to subsidize market-making in small capitalization stocks. We demonstrate that realized spreads decay quickly within the initial microseconds of a trade. The effect reduces the subsidy offered by wider tick sizes, particularly for non-HFT market makers. The profit subsidy from wider tick sizes is also compromised by a significant shift in trading to “taker/maker” exchanges and to midpoint trading in non-exchange venues. The pilot's exception for midpoint trades also accounts for the fact that nearly a third of trading remains in non-exchange venues despite the inclusion of a trade-at rule. Overall, these findings point to considerable inefficiencies in the pilot study's goal of using wider tick sizes to subsidize liquidity provision in small capitalization stocks.",22 May 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 2", 262-316,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12252

The primary source of data for this research has been published judicial opinions that describe cases and their outcomes. However, only a relatively small number of cases result in published opinions, and this sample of cases may be subject to serious biases. Based on computational text analysis of over 150,000 published opinions issued by federal appellate courts in the years 1970–2010, we find strong evidence of data bias based on relationships between the party affiliations of judges on appellate court panels and the characteristics of cases that result in published opinions. These relationships imply that the inferential model that underlies much of the judicial politics literature can lead to biased or spurious findings concerning the causal influence of judicial attributes on case outcomes.",22 May 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 2", 224-261,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12253

These “de-randomizing” events, which include differing probabilities of assignment, post-assignment judicial changes, nonrandom missingness, and nonrandom assignment itself, should be accounted for when making causal claims but are commonly either ignored or not even recognized by researchers utilizing random judicial assignment. The article explores how these de-randomizing events violate the key empirical assumptions underlying randomized studies and offers methodological solutions.

In this article, we develop an empirical methodology to analyze some features that may characterize bi-dimensional courts when dissenting opinions are not frequent. We apply the analysis to the particular case of the Consell de Garanties Estatutàries de Catalunya (Catalan Constitutional Court). The results illustrate that judicial preferences on conservative-progressive grounds are likely to affect the decision outcome of the Court on issues having significant public policy content. Conversely, judicial preferences regarding Spanish-Catalan sovereignty tend to encroach on judgments concerning public policy, thus affecting the outcome of all judgments of the Court regardless of content type. Furthermore, we find that judicial preferences in the Spanish-Catalan sovereignty dimension are pervasive enough to shift the outcome of all types of decisions in favor of Catalan institutions. Policy conclusions are derived.",23 April 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 2", 383-415,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12251
60,How Would Judges Compose Judicial Panels? Theory and Evidence from the Supreme Court of Israel,"Yehonatan Givati, Israel Rosenberg","How would judges compose judicial panels, if they could? We focus on a procedure in the Supreme Court of Israel that allows each justice to compose three-justice panels, collecting an original database of decisions in this procedure. The data reveal strong bias in justices’ panel composition. A Gini coefficient measuring the extent of inequality in each justice's panel composition, which runs between 0 (total equality) and 1 (total inequality), is 0.82 on average, which contradicts the random composition theory. The high variance in the choice of panel members contradicts the professional composition theory. The data support the idea that justices compose panels strategically, and accordingly the data uncover justices’ revealed preference for panel members. We use the data to depict the relationships within the Supreme Court of Israel, and identify three groups of justices. Lastly, we show that justices who were selected by the current Chief Justice under the above procedure, before she became Chief Justice, are more likely to sit on panel with her in ordinary hearings after she became Chief Justice. Since the Chief Justice has the legal authority to compose ordinary panels, this is also consistent with strategic panel composition.",23 March 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 2", 317-341,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12247

The cost is an opportunity cost as experience rating can mitigate the problems associated with unobserved heterogeneity in claim risk, including mispriced coverage and resulting demand distortions. We assess this cost through a counterfactual analysis in which we explore how risk predictions, premiums, and demand in home insurance and two lines of auto insurance would respond to unrestricted multiline experience rating. Using claims data from a large sample of households, we first estimate the variance-covariance matrix of unobserved heterogeneity in claim risk. We then show that conditioning on claims experience leads to material refinements of predicted claim rates. Last, we assess how households’ demand for coverage would respond to multiline experience rating.

New Evidence from Corporate Tax Returns,Edward Fox,"This article uses U.S. corporate tax return data to assess how government revenue would have changed if, over the period 1957–2013, corporations had been subject to a hypothetical corporate cash flow tax—that is, a tax allowing for the immediate deduction of investments in long-lived assets like equipment and structures—rather than the corporate tax regime actually in effect. Holding taxpayer behavior fixed, the data indicate actual corporate tax revenue over the most recent period (1995–2013) differed little from that under the hypothetical cash flow tax. This result has three important implications. First, capital owners appear to bear a large fraction of the corporate tax today. This is because economic theory holds that corporate cash flow taxes are largely borne by capital owners and my result implies that the actual tax behaves in practice much like a cash flow tax. This theory is embodied in the Treasury's most recent model of corporate tax incidence. Applying the model to my results implies that only a small portion (2–10 percent) of the U.S. corporate tax was borne by labor in the years before the 2017 Act and thus capital providers are the primary beneficiaries of the Act's large corporate rate cut. Second, the results suggest that the United States could switch fully over to a cash flow tax, which is likely to be administratively simpler for both the government and corporations, at relatively low revenue cost. Third, the impact of fully switching to a cash flow tax on the operations of the real economy and its efficiency are likely to be fairly small. This is precisely because the corporate tax has already evolved to largely mimic a cash flow tax, and the article explores the reasons underlying this evolution using a novel dataset.",17 February 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 1", 71-115,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12243
64,Separate Opinion Writing Under Mandatory Appellate Jurisdiction: Three-Judge District Court Panels and the Voting Rights Act,"Maxwell Mak, Andrew H. Sidman","Most of the empirical work on separate opinion writing by lower federal court judges examines the U.S. Courts of Appeals. Given the Supreme Court's discretionary jurisdiction, it is argued that dissenting opinions operate as a cue signaling that a case is worthy of review. Concurrences, on the other hand, allow judges to join dispositional majorities while still expressing differences in legal reasoning from the majority. Likely in an effort to minimize dissent, the behavior of circuit court judges is found to be less influenced by ideology when potential dissenters serve with them. Despite the specter of Supreme Court review, these works generally find that the motivation to write separately is based largely in ideologically differences among panelists and less so on preferences of the Supreme Court. What, however, does separate opinion writing look like when the Court's jurisdiction is mandatory, as it is over three-judge district court panels? Among other uses required by law, these district court panels are used to adjudicate cases arising under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These panels also differ from the traditional judicial structure by placing district court judges, who traditionally decide cases individually, in a multimember setting with another district court judge and a circuit court judge. Examining separate opinion writing on these panels, we find that ideological distance from the majority opinion writer is still an important factor. This, however, is conditioned by the preferences of the Supreme Court, which exert a much stronger influence over behavior than they do in the traditional appellate court setting.",03 February 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 1", 116-138,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12244
65,Criminal Sentencing by Preferred Numbers,"Mandeep K. Dhami, Ian K. Belton, Elizabeth Merrall, Andrew McGrath, Sheila M. Bird","Criminal sentencing is a complex cognitive activity often performed by the unaided mind under suboptimal conditions. As such, sentencers may not behave according to policy, guidelines, or training. We analyzed the distribution of sentences meted out in one year in two different jurisdictions (i.e., England and Wales, and New South Wales, Australia). We reveal that sentencers prefer certain numbers when meting out sentence lengths (in custody and community service) and amounts (for fines/compensation). These “common doses” accounted for over 90 percent of sentences in each jurisdiction. The size of these doses increased as sentences became more severe, and doses followed a logarithmic pattern. Our findings are compatible with psychological research on preferred numbers and are reminiscent of Weber's and Fechner's laws. The findings run contrary to arguments against efforts to reduce judicial discretion, and potentially undermine the notion of individualized justice, as well as raise questions about the (cost) effectiveness of sentencing.",03 February 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 1", 139-163,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12246

In particular, we embrace the no-liability counterfactual made possible by the structure of liability rules in the Military Heath System. Active-duty patients seeking treatment from military facilities cannot sue for harms resulting from negligent care, while protections are provided to dependents treated at military facilities and to all patients—active-duty or not—who receive care from civilian facilities. Drawing on this variation and addressing endogeneity in the choice of treatment location by estimating mother fixed effects specifications and by exploiting exogenous shocks to care location choices stemming from base-hospital closures, we find suggestive evidence that liability immunity increases cesarean utilization and treatment intensity during childbirth, with no measurable negative effect on patient outcomes.",29 January 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 1", 4-37,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12241

Our study examines whether the same pattern of sentencing discrepancies is to be found with regard to offenses of omission, the prohibition of which imposes a legal duty to come to the aid of a victim; offenses that are based on social solidarity. The dataset includes all cases in which defendants were convicted of hit-and-run traffic offenses in Israel from 2001 to 2013. The surprising results show that hit-and-run drivers who belong to either the majority or minority ethnic group are likely to be sentenced to more severe punishments when the victim belongs to the same ethnic group than when the victim belongs to a different ethnic group.",06 January 2020,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 17, Issue 1", 164-185,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12245

69,What's in a Name? The Disparate Effects of Identifiability on Offenders and Victims of Sexual Harassment,"Netta Barak-Corren, Daphna Lewinsohn-Zamir","Sexual harassment is undergoing an identification revolution, as more victims choose to forego their anonymity and divulge their identity to the public. Research in social psychology on the identifiability effect has found that identified victims typically generate more empathy and support than unidentified ones. However, this research has been limited largely to monetary donations or to unambiguous cases with uncontested facts; the scholarship has not examined the effects of varying the identifiability of both parties to a conflict. In three large-scale experiments with a representative population (total N = 3,988), we found that in the context of sexual harassment, victims do not gain an identifiability “premium”—whereas offenders do. Offenders identified by their first name only are regarded as more credible and moral and less blameworthy and responsible for the event than unidentified offenders, but the same does not apply to identified victims. Furthermore, when the offender is identified, fewer people perceive the case as involving sexual harassment (Experiment 1), and support for taking measures against the offender declines (Experiment 2). Finally, the identified offender premium exists for offenders of both sexes, but the detrimental effect of identification on victims is moderated by the victim's mode of identification. Specifically, identified female victims who stated willingness to disclose their name publicly fared worse than those preferring that their name not be revealed in public, and the difference between active and passive identification reversed for male victims. The effect of identification mode is moderated by sexist beliefs (Experiment 3). Our results have normative implications for the appropriate balance between publicity and anonymity in various contexts, including social networks, the media, and disciplinary and judicial tribunals.",22 November 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 4", 955-1000,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12233
70,Furman at 45: Constitutional Challenges from California's Failure to (Again) Narrow Death Eligibility,"David C. Baldus, George Woodworth, Catherine M. Grosso, Michael Laurence, Jeffrey A. Fagan, Richard Newell","The Eighth Amendment's “narrowing” requirement for capital punishment eligibility has challenged states since it was recognized in Furman v. Georgia in 1972. This article examines whether California's death penalty scheme complies with this requirement by empirically analyzing 27,453 California convictions for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter with offense dates between January 1978 and June 2002. Using a 1,900-case sample, we examine whether California's death penalty statute fails to comply with the Eighth Amendment's narrowing test. Our findings support two conclusions. First, the death-eligibility rate among California homicide cases is the highest in the nation during that period and in the ensuing decade. We find that 95 percent of all first-degree murder convictions and 59 percent of all second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter convictions were death eligible under California's 2008 statute. Second, a death sentence is imposed in only a small fraction of the death-eligible cases. The California death sentencing rate of 4.3 percent among all death-eligible cases is among the lowest in the nation and over two-thirds lower than the death-sentencing rate in pre-Furman Georgia.",22 November 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 4", 693-730,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12234
71,Race and Class: A Randomized Experiment with Prosecutors,"Christopher Robertson, Shima Baradaran Baughman, Megan S. Wright","Disparities in criminal justice outcomes are well known, and prior observational research has shown correlations between the race of defendants and prosecutors’ decisions about how to charge and resolve cases. Yet causation is questionable: other factors, including unobserved variation in case facts, may account for some of the disparity. Disparities may also be driven by socioeconomic class differences, which are highly correlated with race. This article presents the first blinded, randomized controlled experiment that tests for race and class effects in prosecutors’ charging decisions. Case vignettes are manipulated between subjects in five conditions to test effcts of defendants’ race and class status. In the control condition, race and class are omitted, which allows baseline measures for bias and pilot testing of a blinding reform. Primary outcome variables included whether the prosecutor charged a felony, whether the prosecutor would pursue a fine or imprisonment, and the amounts thereof. With 467 actual prosecutors participating nationwide, we found that race and class did not have detectable prejudicial effects on prosecutorial decisions. This finding, contrary to the majority of observational studies, suggests that other causes drive known disparities in criminal justice outcomes.",22 November 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 4", 807-847,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12235
72,Investigating Cohort Similarity as an Ex Ante Alternative to Patent Forward Citations,Jonathan H. Ashtor,"Forward citations are arguably the most widely used empirical metric for patents, including as indicators of patent information content, cumulative innovation, value, and knowledge flows. However, forward citations have major shortcomings. Citations require long time horizons to accrue, and therefore they cannot be observed until several years after a patent issues. Citation data are often noisy, discontinuous, and highly skewed, complicating empirical analysis. Moreover, recent studies have questioned the reliability of citation data. As such, the most widely used empirical metric of patents is also the most suspect. This study constructs a measure of patents that correlates with forward citations, but is observable ex ante, immediately upon patent issuance or even earlier upon publication of a patent application. In addition, this measure is continuous and evenly distributed, such that it is suitable for large-scale patent analytics applications. Finally, unlike citations, the measure is portable across patent systems, facilitating cross-border comparisons of portfolios and datasets. Specifically, I construct a measure of the similarity of a patent to its technological-temporal cohort, based on linguistic analysis of claim text. I employ advanced computational linguistic techniques to analyze the claims of all U.S. patents issued in the period 1976–2017, over 6 million patents in total, and I calculate the average degree of conceptual similarity of each patented invention to all others in the same technology field and time period cohort. I then extend the methodology to all issued EP patents, over 1.6 million in total. I validate the resulting measures against multiple established patent metrics for U.S. and EP patents. I test the robustness of this measure as a forecast for future patent citations in empirical research and big-data applications. I find that cohort similarity correlates significantly with forward citations received by both U.S. and EP patents. Cohort similarity also substitutes for citations in leading prior studies of R&D output and innovation. Finally, I demonstrate that, unlike citations, cohort similarity is comparable across the U.S. and EP patent systems. Accordingly, cohort similarity may be useful for empirical patent research, comparative studies of patent policy, and analytics of large-scale patent portfolios.",22 November 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 4", 848-880,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12237
73,Traditional Gender Roles and Backlash Against Female Attorneys Expressing Anger in Court,"Jessica M. Salerno, Hannah J. Phalen","Trial advocacy education often stresses the importance of attorneys expressing arguments with emotion to signal conviction. Yet, female attorneys must approach this advice with caution given potential backlash for expressing emotions traditionally considered masculine, like anger. Two experiments (Study 1, N = 220; Study 2, N = 273) demonstrated that people most likely to endorse traditional gender roles exhibited bias against female attorneys expressing anger in court. Participants were recruited nationally and randomly assigned to view an attorney delivering a closing statement in court who either (1) was a man or a woman, and (2) used a neutral or angry tone. They reported how hirable and effective they perceived the attorneys to be and completed measures of several individual difference factors that are established predictors of endorsement of traditional gender roles: ambivalent sexism, political conservatism, and age. Participants who were more likely to hold traditional gender values (i.e., more benevolently sexist, more politically conservative, and older) were more likely to favor attorneys who conformed to gender norms (i.e., male attorneys who expressed anger relative to no anger) and less likely to favor attorneys who violated gender norms (i.e., female attorneys who expressed anger relative to no anger). Thus, female attorneys are faced with the challenge of walking the line between exhibiting traditionally masculine behaviors that are valued by the legal system—but not so much so that they suffer backlash for violating gender norms.",22 November 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 4", 909-932,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12238

This has not only put the European Union and the United States at odds in high-profile investigations of anticompetitive conduct, but also made them race to spread their regulatory models. Using a novel dataset of competition statutes, we investigate this race to influence the world's regulatory landscape and find that E.U. competition laws have been more widely emulated than the U.S. antitrust laws. We then argue that both “push” and “pull” factors explain the appeal of the E.U. competition regime: the European Union actively promotes its model through preferential trade agreements and has an administrative template that is easy to emulate. As E.U. and U.S. regulators offer competing regulatory models in domains as diverse as privacy, finance, and environmental protection, our study sheds light on how global regulatory races are fought and won.",22 November 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 4", 731-766,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12239

76,Dissent Aversion and Sequential Voting in the Brazilian Supreme Court,Felipe de Mendonça Lopes,"The literature on judicial behavior indicates that dissent is costly to the individual judge, for it means an increased workload and the incurrence of reputational costs. This observation leads to the concept of dissent aversion, which is the notion that judges may refrain from dissenting, even though they disagree with the court's position, in order to avoid those costs. In this article, I explore the fact that voting at the Brazilian Supreme Court is sequential, and that this sequence varies in almost every single case, to generate a quasi-experiment that allows for a clearer identification of dissent aversion than is found in other contexts. The main idea is that after a majority has been formed, the justices who vote in sequence know that their votes cannot change the outcome of the case. Hence, they may deviate from their preferred votes and join the majority to avoid the costs of dissenting. Using a unique dataset with vote-level data of all abstract review cases heard by the full Court from 1990 until 2015, this study finds strong evidence of dissent aversion in the Brazilian Supreme Court. Judges who vote after the pivotal judge are significantly less likely to dissent.",23 October 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 4", 933-954,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12236
77,Mutual Funds that Borrow,"A. Joseph Warburton, Michael Simkovic","Securities laws prohibit open-end mutual funds from borrowing more than one-third of their capital structure because of concerns that too much borrowing may harm investors. This is the first article to examine the performance of open-end funds that borrow money within these permissible limits. We construct a database from annual filings of open-end domestic equity mutual funds covering 17 years from 2000 to 2016. Eighteen percent of funds borrowed money for leverage within that time. We find that borrowing funds underperform their nonborrowing peers by 62 basis points per year on a total return basis, while also incurring greater risk. After accommodating for the greater risk taking, we find that borrowers underperform by 48 to 72 basis points annually. By contrast, funds that use derivatives and other financial instruments perform about as well as unlevered mutual funds, before and after adjusting for risk, and with less volatility. This suggests that many mutual funds use derivatives to hedge risk rather than as a substitute for leverage through the capital structure. Thus borrowing may present a greater risk than derivatives, which have received more attention than borrowing. Fund investors and regulators would benefit from greater transparency into mutual fund capital structure.",22 October 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 4", 767-806,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12232
78,When Does Transparency Backfire? Putting Jeremy Bentham's Theory of General Prevention to the Experimental Test,Christoph Engel,"Jeremy Bentham brought enlightenment to criminal policy. He argued that the primary purpose of criminal sanctions should be deterring future crime. To that end he advocated complete transparency. This article investigates Bentham's intuition in a public goods lab experiment by manipulating how much information on punishment experienced by others is available to would-be offenders. Compared with the tone that Jeremy Bentham set, the result is unexpected: when would-be offenders learn about punishment of others at the individual level, they contribute much less to the public project. This is due to an inevitable side effect. Information about punishment is only meaningful together with information about the infraction.",04 October 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 4", 881-908,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12231

80,The German Federal Courts Dataset 1950–2019: From Paper Archives to Linked Open Data,Hanjo Hamann,"Various reasons explain why Europe lags behind the United States in empirical legal studies. One of them is a scarcity of available data on judicial decision making, even at the highest levels of adjudication. By institutional design, civil-law judges have lower personal profiles than their common-law counterparts. Hence very few empirical data are available on how courts are composed and how that composition changes over time. The present project remedies that by easing access to such data and lowering the threshold for empirical studies on judicial behavior. This paper introduces the German Federal Courts Dataset (GFCD) as a resource for empirical legal scholars, with the objective of inspiring more European lawyers to engage with empirical aspects of civil-law adjudication. To that end, several thousand pages of German court documentation were digitized, transcribed into machine-readable tables (ready to be imported into statistics software), and published online (www.richter-im-internet.de). To simultaneously explore innovative ways of sharing public-domain datasets, the data were modeled as linked open data and imported into the Wikidata repository for use in any computational application.",11 August 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 3", 671-688,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12230

McKinley, Alicia Boards, Courtney Gilday","In recent years, law schools have experienced a decline in enrollment and bar passage, and legal education has been challenged to understand this new phenomenon and conduct research that can inform practices and policies regarding law student success. This article presents findings from research conducted at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, a large, midwestern public university, which aimed to investigate which factors and student characteristics contribute to bar passage within the home jurisdiction (Ohio). Results suggest bar passage can be predicted by a wide battery of variables, most notably student performance during the law school course of study. Despite some prior literature that suggests otherwise, however, LSAT and undergraduate GPA were only weakly predictive of first-time bar passage among admitted students: the best prelaw model based on student admissions and demographic data identified just over one-third of the students who ultimately failed the bar on the first attempt. Information from the first year of law school—even just performance in one first semester course—explained significantly more variation in bar passage. Furthermore, data from beyond the first year of legal study, including upper-level course taking in bar-tested subjects, enriched the predictive power of the model, enabling us to predict 78 percent of students who failed the bar compared to just 58 percent after the first year. These preliminary results provide important insights into bar passage, particularly given the increased public scrutiny around incoming student credentials, bar success, and law school performance and accreditation.",26 July 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 3", 605-629,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12228

The natural next question is how, when a judge is improperly influenced, he or she reasons to justify a biased decision. In a set of experiments using incumbent Chinese judges, we first replicated the findings of previous studies that showed judges can be influenced by extra-legal factors. More importantly, we showed that judges may employ a range of legal techniques to rationalize decision biases: they interpret legal standards and legal concepts strategically, finesse the applicability of law, infer or deny causation and foreseeability, and draw different conclusions from facts. Our findings provide a more realistic understanding of how judges behave, and cast doubt on reasoned elaboration as a guarantee of judicial transparency and trustworthiness.",26 July 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 3", 630-670,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12229

The reform boosted joint legal custody by about 75 percentage points. Our research design uses difference-in-differences to estimate reform effects on the likelihood of a contested settlement, length of trial, and transfers between separating parents. The analysis is based on Italian individual-level administrative data, which cover the entire population. The joint custody default appears to have increased dispute rates and length of trial markedly, without affecting transfers. There is no evidence that mothers buy custody rights back through reduced support. Our findings are consistent with the excessive discretion given to judges on some aspects of law implementation, which resulted in a partial application of the reform.",08 July 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 3", 479-514,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12225
84,Entrepreneurs’ Legal Status Choices and the C Corporation Survival Penalty,Emily A. Satterthwaite,"Foundational to the American Dream is the ability to easily and rapidly start a new business. Over the past quarter-century, the limited liability company (LLC) dramatically shifted the choice of legal status calculus for entrepreneurs, and in its wake a consensus against the use of traditional C corporations by closely-held firms emerged. The C corporation, scholars argued, had fatal drawbacks despite its simplicity: tax disadvantages as well as governance inflexibility. Due to historically limited sources of data, there has been little empirical research on choice of entity generally and none that explores the anti-C corporation thesis in particular. Have C corporations underperformed as compared to similarly situated businesses with alternative legal statuses? This article exploits a large panel dataset that contains legal status, owner, business, financing, and other firm-specific information collected from an eight-year survey of nearly 5,000 enterprises that were formed in 2004. It presents four main results. First, C corporation status is associated with firm failure rates that are 38 percent higher (significant at 0.1 percent) than those of non-C corporations with similar characteristics. Second, this C corporation survival penalty persists at nearly the same magnitude and significance even after a subset of “anticipated cash-exit” C corporations with (a) venture capital investors or (b) employee stock option plans are separated out. Third, nonwhite and foreign-born entrepreneurs have a significantly higher likelihood of choosing C corporation status. Fourth, within the subset of firms that appear eligible to elect out of the default (subchapter C) corporate tax classification and into the tax-advantaged subchapter S classification, nonwhite and older entrepreneurs are significantly more likely to remain in C corporation status. These findings suggest that increasing legal status complexity is unlikely to be neutral from a distributive perspective, and may be disproportionately burdensome for marginalized entrepreneurs.",01 July 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 3", 542-604,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12227

When this happens, federal law is applied differently in different parts of the country. Intercircuit splits cause legal nonuniformity, are an impediment to lawyering and judging, and have practical consequences for U.S. law. Despite intercircuit splits’ importance, there is almost no quantitative research about them. We created a unique original dataset that includes intercircuit splits that arose between 2005 and 2013. For each intercircuit split, we identified every circuit and every case involved. These data reveal that one-third of intercircuit splits are resolved by the Supreme Court. Two-thirds are not. We show that those that will be resolved are resolved within three years after they arise and that splits are more likely to be resolved when they exhibit contemporaneous and growing disagreement. However, many such splits are never resolved by the Supreme Court. Those that are not resolved by the Supreme Court continue to yield litigation and do not dissipate on their own. The likelihood of resolution does not rise as time passes.",27 June 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 3", 448-478,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12224

Grosso, Barbara O'Brien","This study of individualized jury selection for 792 potential jurors across 12 North Carolina capital cases, selected with purposive case selection, analyzes the conversations that occur during voir dire to examine the process that produces decisions about who serves on juries. Lawyers question prospective jurors in voir dire partly to gather information about prospective jurors’ ability to decide a case without prejudice. Jury selection, however, suffers from what social scientists call demand characteristics. Demand characteristics provide a respondent with clues about the expected response and interfere with effective information gathering. We identified two characteristics that bear on the presence and strength of demand characteristics: the form and tone of the question. We sorted all 8,583 general legal opinion questions along a four-step scale by combining these characteristics. We then used time-series analyses to examine responses to these questions in sequence. Juror responses were longest and most likely to include an affective utterance when the demand characteristics were weaker, and that loquaciousness and affect fell at each step of the scale. An independent qualitative study replicated these findings, and supported the assertion that length and form are valid measures of quality in this context.",27 June 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 3", 515-541,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12226

Our preferred panel data regression specification, unlike the statistical model of Lott and Mustard that had previously been offered as evidence of crime-reducing RTC laws, both satisfies the parallel trends assumption and generates statistically significant estimates showing RTC laws increase overall violent crime. Our synthetic control approach also finds that RTC laws are associated with 13–15 percent higher aggregate violent crime rates 10 years after adoption.

Schwartz","Since 2011, several papers and articles have speculated about the motivations, activities, and possible anti-competitive effects of hybrid patent assertion entities (PAEs) or, more pejoratively, “patent privateers.” Most prior work has assumed that privateers are essentially extorting money from firms by making weak infringement claims employing weak patents. Under a more classical law and economics approach, we would expect patent privateers to acquire valuable patents to reduce litigation risk and justify patent enforcement. However, to date, there has been no quantitative analysis on this form of patent holder to support or disprove either of these theoretical viewpoints. This article takes a first step toward filling that gap in the analysis by conducting an empirical assessment of patent lawsuits filed between 2010 and 2013. Although several studies have provided useful analysis on who litigates patents and which patents are more likely to be litigated, we add new variables and insights to the analysis. First, our dataset identifies the business models of the parties involved, including hybrid PAEs. Second, we include data on patent reassignments, which allows us to identify when a hybrid PAE takes (partial) possession of a patent. Third, for making comparisons between litigated and unlitigated patents, our dataset includes a set of unlitigated patents that match our litigated patent dataset on several key variables. In this work, we explore three interesting questions: (1) What patent characteristics predict a patent's acquisition by a hybrid PAE? (2) Do hybrid PAEs acquire patents that are more likely to be litigated? and (3) Does reassignment to a hybrid PAE affect the time when a patent is first asserted in litigation? We find that hybrid PAEs tend to acquire patents in the information technology, surgery, and medical instrument fields more often than patents in other technology areas. Hybrid PAEs also obtain relatively higher-quality patents than average, but objective quality metrics generally are on par when compared to patents litigated by firms with other business models. Our analysis also suggests that hybrid PAEs prefer patents with a broader scope of protection. Reassigning a patent to a hybrid PAE is generally associated with higher odds that the patents will be litigated. Finally, patents held by hybrid PAEs at some point in their lifespan experience their first litigation later than those never held by a hybrid PAE. In short, our analysis suggests that patent privateers appear to be focused on improving the possibility of successful patent monetization by focusing on acquiring higher-quality patents with a broader scope of protection, as value and scope are perceived by economists. This research is consistent with the law and economics theory that hybrid PAEs acquire valuable patents and not the extortion theory that they acquire weak patents.",06 May 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 2", 343-380,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12217
90,The Effects of the Extant Clauses Limiting Auditor Liability on Audit Fees and Overall Reporting Quality,"Henock Louis, Thomas C. Pearson, Dahlia M. Robinson, Michael N. Robinson, Amy X. Sun","Regulators and shareholders generally oppose any restriction on clients' rights to sue their auditors, believing that such restrictions would impair reporting quality. However, the evidence suggests that the opposition to limitation of liability agreements (LLAs) between clients and auditors is likely unwarranted. Specifically, the evidence indicates that LLAs are beneficial to clients by lowering their audit fees. More importantly, we find no evidence that they impair financial reporting quality in general. Hence, the extant contracts limiting clients' rights to sue their auditors appear to benefit auditors and their clients without any apparent detriment to the quality of financial reporting.",30 April 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 2", 381-410,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12218

Due to data limitations, however, there is little systematic information about the substance and enforcement of these laws. In this article, we address that problem by introducing two new datasets on competition law regimes around the world. First, we introduce the Comparative Competition Law Dataset, which codes competition laws in 131 jurisdictions between 1889 to 2010. Second, we introduce the Comparative Competition Enforcement Dataset, which provides data on competition agencies’ resources and activities in 100 jurisdictions between 1990 and 2010.

92,"Targeting Bad Doctors: Lessons from Indiana, 1975–2015","Jing Liu, David A. Hyman","For physicians, quality of care is regulated through the medical malpractice and professional licensing/disciplinary systems. The medical malpractice (med mal) system acts through ex post private litigation; the licensing system acts through ex ante permission to practice (i.e., licensure), coupled with ex post disciplinary action against physicians who engage in “bad” behavior. How often do these separate mechanisms for ensuring quality control take action against the same doctors? With what result? We study these questions using 41 years of data (1975–2015) from Indiana, covering almost 30,000 physicians. Disciplinary sanctions are much less common than med mal claims—whether paid or unpaid. Only a small number of physicians are “tagged” by both systems. Disciplinary risk increases with the number of past med mal claims. Paid claims have a greater impact than unpaid claims, and large payouts (≥100 k, 2015$) have a slightly greater impact than small payouts on disciplinary risk. The risk of a paid claim increases with more severe disciplinary sanctions (i.e., revocation and suspension). Our findings suggest an obvious model for the interaction of these two systems.",21 April 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 2", 248-280,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12214
93,Characteristics of Lawyers Who Are Subject to Complaints and Misconduct Findings,"Tara Sklar, Yamna Taouk, David Studdert, Matthew Spittal, Ron Paterson, Marie Bismark","Regulators of the legal profession are charged with protecting the public by ensuring lawyers are fit to practice law. However, their approach tends to be reactive and case based, focusing on the resolution of individual complaints. Regulators generally do not seek to identify patterns and trends across their broader caseloads and the legal profession as a whole. Using administrative data routinely collected by the main regulator of the legal profession in Victoria, Australia, we characterized complaints lodged between 2005 and 2015 and the lawyers against whom they were made. We also analyzed risk factors for complaints and misconduct findings. We found that the odds of being subject to a complaint were higher among lawyers who were male, older, had trust account authority, and whose legal practices were smaller, in nonurban locations, and incorporated. A deeper understanding of these risk factors could support efforts to improve professional standards and reform regulatory practices.",17 April 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 2", 318-342,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12216
94,Stock Market Reactions to India's 2016 Demonetization,"Dhammika Dharmapala, Vikramaditya S. Khanna","On November 8, 2016, the Indian government made a surprise announcement that certain currency notes (representing 86 percent of the currency then in circulation) would no longer be legal tender (although they could be deposited in banks over a limited period). The stated reason for this sudden “demonetization” was to combat tax evasion and corruption associated with “unaccounted for” cash. We compute abnormal returns for different subsamples of firms—defined by industry, ownership structure, and other characteristics—on the Indian stock market around this event. There is little evidence that sectors thought to be associated with greater tax evasion or corruption experienced significantly different returns. However, we find substantial positive returns for banks and for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These effects persist over longer time horizons, implying that the initial reactions do not show any indication of subsequent reversal. The bank results appear to indicate a market expectation of a persistent increase in financial depth. We also find a pattern of higher returns for industries that are characterized by a greater dependence on external finance, possibly suggesting an expectation of an easing of financial constraints. The returns for SOEs are more puzzling and we canvass a number of potential explanations, while leaving further examination of this finding to future research.",05 April 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 2", 281-317,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12213

96,Accuracy and Fairness for Juvenile Justice Risk Assessments,Richard Berk,"Risk assessment algorithms used in criminal justice settings are often said to introduce “bias.” But such charges can conflate an algorithm's performance with bias in the data used to train the algorithm with bias in the actions undertaken with an algorithm's output. In this article, algorithms themselves are the focus. Tradeoffs between different kinds of fairness and between fairness and accuracy are illustrated using an algorithmic application to juvenile justice data. Given potential bias in training data, can risk assessment algorithms improve fairness and, if so, with what consequences for accuracy? Although statisticians and computer scientists can document the tradeoffs, they cannot provide technical solutions that satisfy all fairness and accuracy objectives.

97,Single Motherhood and the Abolition of Coverture in the United States,"Hazem Alshaikhmubarak, R. Richard Geddes, Shoshana A. Grossbard","Under the common-law system of coverture in the United States, a married woman relinquished control of property and wages to her husband. Many U.S. states passed acts between 1850 and 1920 that expanded a married woman's right to keep her market earnings and to own separate property. The former were called married women's earnings acts (MWEAs) and the latter married women's property acts (MWPAs). Scholarly interest in the acts’ effects is growing, with researchers examining how the acts affected outcomes such as women's wealth holding and educational attainment. The acts’ impact on women's nonmarital birth decisions remains unexamined, however. We postulate that the acts caused women to anticipate greater benefits from having children within rather than outside of marriage. We thus expect the passage of MWPAs and MWEAs to reduce the likelihood that single women become mothers of young children. We use probit regression to analyze individual data from the U.S. Census for the years 1860 to 1920. We find that the property acts in fact reduced the likelihood that single women have young children. We also find that the “de-coverture” acts’ effects were stronger for literate women, for U.S.-born women, in states with higher female labor-force participation, and in more rural states, consistent with predictions.",18 February 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 1", 94-118,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12210

In the absence of compensation, the article reveals that individuals commonly perceive the moral value of breach depending on the consequences thereof, with the unfairness of the outcome—and not the inefficiency—as the preponderant factor. Contract law reflects observed interpersonal morality and allows courts to rescind the contract on grounds of impossibility, impracticability, or frustration if the breach is fair and the promisor avoids exceptionally high losses, but not if the breach is unfair and the promisor breaches to profit from a substitutive transaction. The law, moreover, does not punish breach, nor inevitably require performance by the promisor, but instead aims at compensating the victim, thereby reflecting how most individuals perceive breach followed by compensation, from a normative standpoint: as not morally wrong.",18 February 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 1", 119-142,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12211

Dana, Janice Nadler","Corporate adoption of politically contestable practices (e.g., sustainable forestry; cage-free eggs) is increasingly common. In two studies, we empirically explore the relationship between corporate practices and subsequent public support for legislation mandating such practices. One hypothesis is that public support for new legislation decreases following corporate action because the private sector is perceived to be adequately managing the problem, thus obviating the need for a legislative response. A competing hypothesis is that public support for new legislation increases because people are prompted to recognize the issue in question as one in need of regulation. Our results suggest that announced changes to corporate practices can increase public support for legislation, but the effects differ depending on the political orientation of the perceiver.

100,Lawyers at the Peak of Their Careers: A 30-Year Longitudinal Study of Job and Life Satisfaction,"John Monahan, Jeffrey Swanson","A decade ago, we conducted a 20-year longitudinal study of career and life satisfaction among the class matriculating at the University of Virginia School of Law in 1987. Here, we extend our repeated measures follow-up from 20 to 30 years—from the time when respondents were a mean of 43 to the time they were a mean of 53 years old. The 2017 survey employed substantially the same instrument used in 2007, with the addition of a new section assessing potential period effects occurring over the past decade that might have influenced respondents' working conditions, including a stronger stress on economic sustainability. The 2017 response rate was 81 percent of those who had responded to the 2007 survey (constituting 58 percent of the class matriculating in 1987). We found respondents to have taken diverse career paths, with no single work setting accounting for more than one-quarter of the respondents and with fully one-third of the respondents changing jobs in the past decade. Marked gender differences in the professional lives of respondents persisted (e.g., women continued to be much more likely than men to forego full-time employment “in order to care for children” (30 percent vs. 4 percent)). Working conditions at large private law firms stayed problematic, with the portion of respondents negatively affected by a stronger stress on economic sustainability being twice as high among those working in large firms (77 percent) than among those working in other settings (38 percent). Finally, both career satisfaction and life satisfaction again were found to be high, with 77 percent of respondents satisfied with the decision to become a lawyer, and 91 percent satisfied with their lives more broadly.",08 January 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 1", 4-25,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12207

Caps on noneconomic damages are the principal proposed remedy. Do these caps in fact reduce testing, overall health-care spending, or both? We study the effects of “third-wave” damage caps, adopted in the 2000s, on specific areas that are expected to be sensitive to med mal risk: imaging rates, cardiac interventions, and lab and radiology spending, using patient-level data, with extensive fixed effects and patient-level covariates. We find heterogeneous effects. Rates for the principal imaging tests rise, as does Medicare Part B spending on laboratory and radiology tests. In contrast, cardiac intervention rates (left-heart catheterization, stenting, and bypass surgery) do not rise (and likely fall). We find some evidence that overall Medicare Part B rises, but variable results for Part A spending.

102,Development of a General Legal Confidence Scale: A First Implementation of the Rasch Measurement Model in Empirical Legal Studies,"P. Pleasence, N. J. Balmer","Legal capability has long been of evident importance in our understanding of legal problem resolution behavior. Although legal capability remains a contested concept, there is much commonality between specifications. Some aspects are generic, while others—such as legal confidence—are particular to law. Such law-specific measures as have been developed to date have been developed in an ad-hoc fashion; with no attempts made to test psychometric properties, using either classical test theory or modern psychometric methods. This has been a shortcoming in the empirical legal field, weakening theoretical development and precluding reliable estimation of changes in levels of legal capability over time. In this article, we set out details of a study aimed at introducing new methods to scale development in the field of empirical legal studies based on the approaches that have evolved in other fields and the latest developments in psychometric modeling. Specifically, we set out details of the use of a specially designed item pool—based on an increasingly demanding legal scenario—and Rasch analysis to develop a general legal confidence scale. Once the 12 item pool items were reduced to a final set of six, this yielded a scale with good psychometric properties: a General Legal Confidence (GLC) Scale. The scale showed good overall fit, item fit, person fit, targeting, and internal consistency. All items had ordered thresholds, there was no response dependence, items were unidimensional, and there was no evidence of differential item functioning. The GLC scale constitutes an effective measure of general legal confidence, and demonstrates it is possible to arrive at robust and coherent law-specific measures of legal capability through the careful design of questions and application of the latest psychometric modeling techniques.",07 January 2019,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 16, Issue 1", 143-174,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12212

McMichael,"The increased use of nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) represents an important option for increasing access to healthcare. I explore the effect of two types of laws on the supply of NPs and PAs: occupational licensing laws that limit the practices of NPs and PAs and caps on noneconomic damages. Relaxing licensing laws to allow NPs to practice with less physician oversight increases the supply of NPs in areas with few practicing physicians by 60 percent—though the size of this increase decreases as the supply of physicians grows. I find similar, but weaker, evidence for granting PAs more autonomy. Noneconomic damages caps increase the supply of both NPs and PAs by about 60 percent at the lowest levels of physician supply. Examining the effects of these laws on the prevalence of health professional shortage areas, I find that licensing laws have meaningful effects on access to care.",10 October 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 4", 732-771,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12198
106,"An Empirical Study of Corporate Default Rules and Menus in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan","Yu-Hsin Lin, Yun-chien Chang","Competing theories of default rules and menus in contract law and corporate law provide different accounts of their effects. However, empirical studies are scant, and all focus on U.S. law. Given that corporate ownership outside of the United State is usually concentrated, and institutional settings are vastly different, one might wonder whether corporate law and economic theories on default rules and menus aptly explain corporate practices in other countries. To that end, this article analyzes a unique dataset of 498 randomly sampled and hand-coded charters of public firms in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. While the data do not enable us to make causal inferences, we make a descriptive contribution to the literature by examining whether corporate practices in the studied jurisdictions are consistent with the U.S. theories. The major findings are that firms often opted into menus and rarely opted out of default rules without menus, thereby supporting the minimization of transaction cost theory. However, Chinese firms may follow default rules for noneconomic reasons. Hansmann's delegation theory explains the short corporate charters observed in Taiwan, but not those in China and Hong Kong. Corporations in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan do not appear to be systematically more pro-minority or pro-controller than their jurisdictions' corporate laws. This contradicts the principal-agent theory.",04 October 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 4", 875-915,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12200

These demographic changes have been met by efforts to defend the local dominant culture using majority nationalism laws, intended to protect the cultural heritage of the majority. We empirically examine majority nationalism laws’ expressive effects on patterns of minority discrimination using the Israeli draft Nation Law (NL) as a case study. Drawing on two experimental surveys of a representative sample of the majority population of Israel (N = 602), our results lend weak support to the hypothesis that majority nationalism laws increase bias against minorities, and modest support to the hypothesis that such laws generate unintended spillover effects across different minority groups and from the public to the private sphere. Our main finding is that majority nationalism laws provoke a backlash reaction from those who oppose them. We define this as the provocative effect of law and discuss its relation to the expressive law theory. The results suggest that the effects of majority nationalism laws may vary systematically across ideological groups and spheres of discrimination.",03 October 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 4", 951-986,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12199

This discretion can lead to unequal treatment and denial of due process, especially when disadvantaged populations are arrested for nonviolent property crimes. We present a Bayesian analysis of arrests under a vaguely worded statutory scheme for retail theft in Texas, in which a shoplifter who is guilty of property theft is also guilty of organized retail theft. Using arrest data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, we find wide variation across law enforcement agencies in initial charging categories, with black and Hispanic arrestees being charged for the more serious crime more often than white arrestees. The racial discrepancy is greater for agencies serving cities with higher per-capita income.

Yet the literature leaves open the question of how public opinion affects judicial decisions on less salient issues, which not only dominate the dockets of state supreme courts but also encompass areas of major legal and policy significance. We consider one such issue that infrequently emerges in judicial campaigns, environmental law. Specifically, we collect an original dataset of over 5,000 judicial votes on nearly 1,000 cases heard in 40 state supreme courts from 1990–2014. We find that for the dataset as a whole, there is not a significant effect of public opinion on judicial decisions in any of the major judicial selection systems. However, in the few states in which environmental issues have been the subject of campaign attack ads, we find evidence of such a relationship during the years following the ads.

I do not find statistically significant evidence of (2) in two examples of instituting a similar liability: when several large U.S. credit card issuers dropped mandatory arbitration clauses (that effectively precluded class action lawsuits) and when U.S. residential mortgage creditors became liable for failing to consider a borrower's future ability to repay the mortgage, suggesting that these events improved consumer surplus and might have improved social welfare.",01 October 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 4", 800-841,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12203

For a long time, the new procedure was rarely utilized. Then, the adoption process gained momentum. We discuss alternative explanations for this phenomenon. We find that class action filings are explained not only by law firms' own litigation outcomes, but also by the available information about other firms' success, and their cumulative filing pattern. We thus explain the observed filing pattern by both individual and social learning, and cannot exclude mere social imitation.",27 September 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 4", 708-731,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12202

An Empirical Study of Related-Party Transactions in Hong Kong and Singapore,"Christopher Chen, Wai Yee Wan, Wei Zhang","This article examines the effect of imposing higher board independence requirements on private benefit extraction by corporate management or controlling shareholders in Hong Kong and Singapore. This article shows that higher board independence negatively correlates with fewer related-party transactions (RPT), though in a nonlinear relationship with the marginal effect of higher board independence diminished. However, we find no clear causal effect of Hong Kong's imposition of a minimum board independence threshold in 2012 on reducing tunneling. Our data also show that higher concentration of ownership might not be associated with more tunneling by RPTs. Overall, this research lends support to the literature on the role of better corporate governance in addressing agency costs, although the exact effect of a particular change of corporate governance rules on tunneling is unclear, and there could be less utility in imposing even higher board independence requirements beyond a certain optimal level in the future.",25 September 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 4", 987-1020,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12197

116,Predicting Sex Offender Recidivism: Using the Federal Post Conviction Risk Assessment Instrument to Assess the Likelihood of Recidivism Among Federal Sex Offenders,Thomas H. Cohen,"Sex offenses are among the crimes that provoke serious public concern. The federal response to the problem of sex offending has resulted in an exponential increase in the number of sex offenders on federal post-conviction supervision; however, relatively few studies have explored whether and how well the actuarial risk instrument currently used by federal probation officers—the federal Post Conviction Risk Assessment instrument (PCRA)—accurately predicts reoffending behavior among the federal sex offender population. This study uses a unique dataset of approximately 5,300 convicted sex offenders on federal supervision to investigate the PCRA's capacity to effectively predict subsequent recidivism activity for convicted federal sex offenders. Results show that the PCRA accurately predicts recidivistic behavior involving the commission of any felony or misdemeanor offenses, violent offenses, and probation revocations for this population. However, the PCRA's predictive capacities deteriorate when the instrument is used to assess the likelihood of sexual recidivism. In addition, this study showed that offenders convicted of online child pornography offenses presented some challenges in terms of predicting their reoffending behavior as they manifested lower PCRA risk scores and recidivism rates than offenders convicted of other major federal sexual offenses that involve hands-on behavior.",14 August 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 3", 456-481,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12184
117,Compliance Externalities and the Role-Model Effect on Law Abidance: Field and Survey Experimental Evidence,"Marco Fabbri, Sven Hoeppner","Recent theories of compliance predict that, apart from utilitarian considerations, individual decisions to respect or break the law account for virtuous motives and nonutilitarian willingness to promote the social good. We test whether empirical evidence supports these theories by collecting data on cyclists' decisions to ignore a red traffic light in a natural setting. We consider different situations where noncompliance is costly, but without risk, and where material deterrence incentives from legal sanctions remain constant. The only difference between the situations lies in who is observing the cyclists' decision at the traffic light at the intersection of a footpath with the cycle track. We find that about 68 percent of cyclists ignore the red traffic light when there is the opportunity to do so. This frequency does not change substantially when adult bystanders are observing at the pedestrian traffic light. Interestingly, the violation frequency drops to about 10 percent when children are present. Robustness checks rule out the alternative explanations that this change is driven by concerns for children's unpredictable actions, or by the simultaneous presence of other adult bystanders. In a vignette study, we additionally dissect the cyclists' motives for being compliant. Results suggest a “role-model effect” on compliance. When asked, the majority of participants report that the willingness to educate and be a good example is the most important reason for their decision to abide by the law, hence supporting the empirical observation that promoting the social good can be an important nonutilitarian motive of compliance decisions.",14 August 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 3", 539-562,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12185
118,A Rose by Any Other Name: Understanding Judicial Decisions that Do Not Cite Precedent,"Kawin Ethayarajh, Andrew Green, Albert H. Yoon","In common-law countries, legal precedent serves as a foundation of judicial opinions. Judges cite precedent to explain their decision, and it is this use of precedent that threads one decision to another. The Supreme Court in India stands in contrast to its counterparts in other countries in that it annually decides not dozens, but thousands, of cases. Perhaps unsurprisingly, nearly half the Court's decisions do not cite any precedent at all. This article examines this phenomenon, specifically how it affects judges’ commitment to the common law, in substance if not in form. Examining every Court decision for the period 1950–2010, we textually analyze the opinions using machine learning to determine what connection, if any, exists between cases. We find that it is possible to accurately model how the Court cites to existing precedent and that even for decisions without any citations, there is almost always at least one prior decision the Court could have cited. Our finding suggest that time and resource demands are primarily responsible for the failure to cite relevant precedent, but that the Court acts efficiently, given the constraints placed on it, in deciding in which decisions to include precedent. This research, however, leaves unanswered whether the Court provides sufficient guidance to lower courts.",14 August 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 3", 563-596,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12186
119,The Politics of Selecting Chevron Deference,"Kent Barnett, Christina L. Boyd, Christopher J. Walker","In this article, we examine an important threshold question in judicial behavior and administrative law: When do federal circuit courts decide to use the Chevron deference framework and when do they select a framework that is less deferential to the administrative agency's statutory interpretation? The question is important because the purpose of Chevron deference is to give agencies—not judges—policy-making space within statutory interpretation. We expect, nonetheless, that whether to invoke the Chevron framework is largely driven by political dynamics, with judges adopting a less deferential standard when their political preferences do not align with the agency's decision. To provide insight, we analyze circuit court decisions from 2003 until 2013 that review agency statutory interpretations. Our results—from the largest and most comprehensive database of its kind—provide partial confirmation of our expectations. When courts reviewed liberal agency interpretations, all panels—liberal, moderate, and conservative—were equally likely to apply Chevron. However, when reviewing conservative agency interpretations, liberal panels selected the Chevron deference framework significantly less frequently than conservative panels. Contrary to limited prior studies, we find no evidence of “whistleblower” or disciplining effects when judges of different judicial ideologies comprised the panel. Viewed together, our results provide important implications for the current debate on whether to eliminate, narrow, or clarify Chevron's domain.",14 August 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 3", 597-619,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12187
120,Who Benefits from Repealing Tampon Taxes? Empirical Evidence from New Jersey,"Christopher Cotropia, Kyle Rozema","Many state and local governments exclude some medical products from the sales tax base, including some that are primarily used by men such as hair growth products. However, tampons and other menstrual hygiene products are subject to sales taxes in most states. A recent social movement advocates for the repeal of these “tampon taxes” and several class action lawsuits have been filed against states citing equal protection violations. In this article, we use the 2005 elimination of menstrual hygiene products from the sales tax base in New Jersey as a natural experiment to study who benefits from the repeal of tampon taxes. We find that the tax break is fully shifted to consumers, but that the tax break is not distributed equally. Low-income consumers enjoy a benefit from the repeal of the tax by more than the size of the repealed tax. For high-income consumers, the tax break is shared equally with producers. The results suggest that repealing tampon taxes removes an unequal tax burden and could make menstrual hygiene products more accessible for low-income consumers.",14 August 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 3", 620-647,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12188

122,Appeals by the Prosecution,"Nancy J. King, Michael Heise","Scholarly and public debates about criminal appeals have largely taken place in an empirical vacuum. This study builds on our prior empirical work exploring defense-initiated criminal appeals and focuses on criminal appeals by state and federal prosecutors. Exploiting data drawn from a recently released national sample of appeals by state prosecutors decided in 2010, as well as data from all appeals by federal prosecutors to the U.S. Courts of Appeals terminated in the years 2011 through 2016, we provide a detailed snapshot of noncapital, direct appeals by prosecutors, including extensive information on crime type, claims raised, type of defense representation, oral argument, and opinion type, as well judicial selection, merits review, and relief. Findings include a rate of success for state prosecutor appeals about four times greater than that for defense appeals (roughly 40 percent of appeals filed compared to 10 percent). The likelihood of success for state prosecutor-appellants appeared unrelated to the type of crime, claim, or defense counsel, whether review was mandatory or discretionary, or whether the appellate bench was selected by election rather than appointment. State high courts, unlike intermediate courts, did not decide these appeals under conditions of drastic asymmetry. Of discretionary criminal appeals reviewed on the merits by state high courts, 41 percent were prosecutor appeals. In federal courts, prosecutors voluntarily dismissed more than half the appeals they filed, but were significantly less likely to withdraw appeals from judgments of acquittal and new trial orders after the verdict than to withdraw appeals challenging other orders. Among appeals decided on the merits, federal prosecutors were significantly more likely to lose when facing a federal defender as an adversary compared to a CJA panel attorney.",14 August 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 3", 482-538,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12190

124,Feasibility of a Health-Utility Approach to Quantifying Noneconomic Losses from Personal Injury,"Natalie Carvalho, David Fish, Genevieve M. Grant, Joshua A. Salomon, David M. Studdert","There is wide agreement that existing approaches to valuing noneconomic losses from personal injury lack coherence. “Health-utility” measurement—an approach developed in health economics for valuing health outcomes in public health and medicine—holds considerable promise for bringing greater rationality and consistency to assessments of injury-related noneconomic loss. However, the feasibility of creating utility measures that are suitable for use in personal injury compensation has not been demonstrated. This study takes that step. We surveyed more than 4,100 members of the general public in Australia to assess people's preferences for a variety of nonfatal “health states.” The health states were selected to reflect harms commonly seen in claims to compensation schemes for transport and workplace accidents. We then followed established methods for transforming the survey responses into a “severity weight” for each health state. We show how these severity weights can be used to define tiers in a schedule for guiding noneconomic damages determinations. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of the approach, and consider implementation challenges.",06 April 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 2", 278-319,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12179
125,Do Checklists Make a Difference? A Natural Experiment from Food Safety Enforcement,"Daniel E. Ho, Sam Sherman, Phil Wyman","Inspired by Atul Gawande's bestselling Checklist Manifesto, many commentators have called for checklists to solve complex problems in law and public policy. We study a unique natural experiment to provide the first systematic evidence of checklists in law. In 2005, the Public Health Department of Seattle and King County revised its health code, subjecting half of inspection items to a checklist, with others remaining on a free-form recall basis. Through in-depth qualitative analysis, we identify the subset of code items that remained substantively identical across revisions, and then apply difference-in-differences to isolate the checklist effect in more than 95,000 inspections from 2001–2009. Contrary to scholarly and popular claims that checklists can improve the administration of law, the checklist has no detectable effect on inspector behavior. Making a violation more salient by elevating it from “noncritical” to “critical” status, however, has a pronounced effect. The benefits of checklists alone are considerably overstated.",28 March 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 2", 242-277,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12178
126,"Law and Psychology Grows Up, Goes Online, and Replicates","Krin Irvine, David A. Hoffman, Tess Wilkinson-Ryan","Over the last 30 years, legal scholars have increasingly deployed experimental studies, particularly hypothetical scenarios, to test intuitions about legal reasoning and behavior. That movement has accelerated in the last decade, facilitated in large part by cheap and convenient Internet participant recruiting platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk. The widespread use of online subjects, a practice that dramatically lowers the barriers to entry for experimental research, has been controversial. At the same time, the field of experimental psychology is experiencing a public crisis of confidence widely discussed in terms of the “replication crisis.” At present, law and psychology research is arguably in a new era, in which it is both an accepted feature of the legal landscape and also a target of fresh skepticism. The moment is ripe for taking stock. In this article, we bring an empirical approach to these problems. Using three canonical law and psychology findings, we document the challenges and the feasibility of reproducing results across platforms. We evaluate the extent to which we are able to reproduce the original findings with contemporary subject pools (Amazon Mechanical Turk, other national online platforms, and in-person labs). We partially replicate all three results, and show marked similarities in subject responses across platforms. In the context of the experiments here, we conclude that meaningful replication requires active intervention in order to keep the materials relevant and sensible. The second aim is to compare Amazon Mechanical Turk subjects to the original samples and to the replication samples. We find, consistent with the weight of recent evidence, that the Amazon Mechanical Turk samples are reasonably appropriate for these kinds of scenario studies. Subjects are highly similar to subjects on other online platforms and in-person samples, though they differ in their high level of attentiveness. Finally, we review the growing replication literature across disciplines, as well as our firsthand experience, to propose a set of standard practices for the publication of results in law and psychology.",28 March 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 2", 320-355,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12180

The parties then may be required to compensate CMS for its conditional payments. In a simple settlement model, this makes settlement less likely. Also, the reporting delays and uncertainty regarding the size of these conditional payments are likely to further frustrate the settlement process. We provide results, using data from a large insurer, showing that, on average, implementation of the MSP reporting amendments led to a delay in the resolution of disputes involving auto accidents of about six months.",28 March 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 2", 356-377,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12181

Gutierrez","Despite a constitutional mandate that jury pools in the United States be representative of their communities, almost no datasets exist that can describe typical levels and patterns of jury representation. We present data from federal courts on the composition of jury pools in 52 areas, representing 764 counties. We also compare current composition estimates to those available 20 years ago from published sources. Results show that, by far, some amount of underrepresentation in jury pools is the norm, and levels of attrition fail all but one proposed method for calculating and defining “not fair and reasonable” amounts of underrepresentation. On average, expected losses range between one and three members of each minority group from jury venires of 40 to 60 people. We find no evidence that the impact of attrition on Latino communities is greater than on African-American communities and, unlike Latinos, no indicators of African-American representation levels show improvement over time. We discuss the challenges of addressing racial/ethnic attrition in jury pools, which is evident but, given the repeated small-group sampling of venires, may be small in effect in any single case.",28 March 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 2", 378-405,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12182
129,Judging Judicial Foreclosure,Brian D. Feinstein,"For the third time in the last several decades, policymakers are contemplating an overhaul of mortgage-finance regulations. Despite the considerable attention paid to how ex ante regulations affect the availability of credit and the appropriateness of the mortgage products that lenders offer, however, our understanding of how the legal framework governing foreclosures—a form of ex post borrower protection—affects mortgage lending is incomplete. Leveraging data on loan applicants that are geographically proximate and subject to the same federal mortgage-finance regulations and nearly identical state foreclosure regimes—but for the presence or absence of a judicial foreclosure requirement—this analysis enables the identification of the independent effects of judicial-foreclosure requirements on loan approval decisions and the share of approved applicants who are offered subprime loans. I find that lenders adopt a more conservative posture in evaluating loan applications in jurisdictions where they must haul delinquent borrowers into court. All else equal, loan applications are less likely to be approved and approved borrowers are less likely to be offered subprime loans in judicial-foreclosure states. Further, some models indicate that these results may be amplified for borrowers with lower socioeconomic status, suggesting that judicial supervision of foreclosures may have tempered one of the more flagrant practices of the subprime era: providing high-rate mortgages with a greater likelihood of default to lower-income and minority borrowers. These results suggest that, in contemplating changes to the regulation of mortgage lenders, policymakers should consider state foreclosure law to be among the tools in their regulatory toolkit.",28 March 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 2", 406-451,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12183

131,Are Court Orders Sticky? Evidence on Distributional Impacts from School Finance Litigation,Zachary Liscow,"Whether welfare analysis of legal rule changes should evaluate distributional outcomes as well as efficiency depends crucially on how much their distributional impacts stick. That is, do court mandates ultimately affect the distribution of taxes and spending or do legislatures offset the distributional consequences of those court orders with other changes? Little is known about this question. To offer insight into it, I use an event study methodology to show how state revenues and expenditures respond to court orders to increase funding for schools. I find that the court orders' distributional impacts do stick. The education spending is financed by tax increases that do not target the largest beneficiaries of the increased education spending, the poor and those with children. Thus, since the main beneficiaries of the school spending do not pay a disproportionate share of the costs, advocates for school finance reform are effective at transferring resources to poor families. The results suggest that welfare analysis of these legal rules should take into account not only efficiency but also distribution, in a departure from traditional economic analysis of legal rules.",13 February 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 1", 4-40,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12172
132,Screening Plaintiffs and Selecting Defendants in Medical Malpractice Litigation: Evidence from Illinois and Indiana,"Mohammad Rahmati, David A. Hyman, Bernard Black, Jing Liu, Charles Silver","Many physicians and tort reform advocates believe that most medical malpractice (med mal) claims are “frivolous.” As evidence, they often rely on reports that only about 20 percent of claims result in a payout. Many physicians and reform advocates also believe that plaintiffs lawyers often sue every health provider with even a remote a connection to the patient. Plaintiffs’ lawyers, however, insist that they screen med mal cases carefully, and when they bring a claim, are selective in whom they sue. Can these perspectives be harmonized? We study this question using databases of every insured med mal claim closed in Illinois during 2000–2010 and in Indiana during 1980–2015, and with semi-structured interviews with six plaintiffs’ lawyers. We innovate by using defense costs to assess whether plaintiffs’ lawyers take a case seriously. We treat cases with under $5k in defense spending as “nonserious” unless they have a payout over $25k. We find evidence that many “cases” are nonserious—suggesting that screening is an ongoing process that does not end when a case is accepted. Observed success rates are sensitive to whether one counts “claims” (each defendant is a separate claim) or “cases” (one plaintiff vs. one or more defendants), includes pro se and/or only represented cases, and includes all versus only serious cases. If we analyze cases instead of claims and limit to serious, represented cases, we find much higher success rates (43 percent in Illinois; 44 percent in Indiana). Success rates are higher still in cases brought solely against institutional defendants (58 percent in Illinois; 68 percent in Indiana). Plaintiffs’ lawyers are also selective in the number of defendants they sue. In med mal cases involving only physicians and/or institutions, the mean number of defendants is 1.5 in Illinois and 1.8 in Indiana.",13 February 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 1", 41-79,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12173

Schwartz","This article empirically studies current claims that patent trolls, also known as patent assertion entities (PAEs) or non-practicing entities (NPEs), behave badly in litigation by bringing frivolous patent infringement suits and seeking nuisance fee settlements. The study explores these claims by examining the relationship between the type of patentee-plaintiffs and litigation outcomes (e.g., settlement, grant of summary judgment, trial, and procedural dispositions), while taking into account, among other factors, the technology of the patents being asserted and the identity of the lawyers and judges. The study finds significant heterogeneity among different patent holder entity types. Individual inventors, failed operating companies, patent holding companies, and large patent aggregators each have distinct litigation strategies largely consistent with their economic posture and incentives. These PAEs appear to litigate differently from each other and from operating companies. Accordingly, to the extent any patent policy reform targets specific patent plaintiff types, such reforms should go beyond the practicing entity versus non-practicing entity distinction and understand how the proposed legislation would impact more granular and meaningful categories of patent owners.",13 February 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 1", 80-125,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12174

This study examines a procedure—a hybrid between tort litigation and a victim compensation fund—that not only allowed sexual abuse victims to seek monetary compensation on an individual basis, but also nonmonetary relief, including an apology, recognition, and measures against those responsible for the abuse. The publication of all decisions offers a unique opportunity to analyze what victims pursued by filing a claim, whether what they were offered matched their objectives, and what impacted the probability of victims obtaining certain types of nonmonetary relief. After analyzing 1,237 decisions, this study reveals a mismatch between what victims sought and what they were offered. Surprisingly, the presence or absence of a few panelists (out of 27) turns out to be the best predictor of whether adjudicators ordered nonmonetary relief. Consequently, whether victims obtained nonmonetary relief did not only depend on a proper legal infrastructure, but mostly on the mentality and attitudes of those participating in the system.",13 February 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 1", 126-164,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12175
135,Is E.U. Merger Control Used for Protectionism? An Empirical Analysis,"Anu Bradford, Robert J. Jackson Jr., Jonathon Zytnick","The European Commission has often used its merger-review power to challenge high-profile acquisitions involving non-E.U. companies, giving rise to concerns that its competition authority has evolved into a powerful tool for industrial policy. The Commission has been accused of deliberately targeting foreign—especially U.S.—acquirers, while facilitating the creation of European national champions. These concerns, however, rest on a few famous anecdotes. In this article, we introduce a unique dataset that allows us to provide the first rigorous examination of these claims. Our analysis of the over 5,000 mergers reported to the Commission between 1990 and 2014 reveals no evidence that the Commission has systematically used its authority to protectionist ends. If anything, our results suggest that the Commission is less likely to challenge transactions involving non-E.U. acquirers.

136,Outcaste Politics and Organized Crime in Japan: The Effect of Terminating Ethnic Subsidies,"J. Mark Ramseyer, Eric B. Rasmusen","In 1969, Japan launched a massive subsidy program for the “burakumin” outcastes. The subsidies attracted the mob, and the higher incomes now available through organized crime attracted many burakumin. Thus, the subsidies gave new support to the tendency many Japanese already had to equate the burakumin with the mob. The government ended the subsidies in 2002. We explore the effect of the termination by merging 30 years of municipality data with a long-suppressed 1936 census of burakumin neighborhoods. We find that out-migration from municipalities with more burakumin increased after the end of the program. Apparently, the subsidies restrained young burakumin from joining mainstream society. We also find that despite the end of government-subsidized amenities, once the subsidies neared their end, real estate prices rose in municipalities with burakumin neighborhoods. With the subsidies gone and the mob in retreat, other Japanese found the formerly burakumin communities increasingly attractive places to live.",13 February 2018,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 15, Issue 1", 192-238,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12177

139,Piling On? An Empirical Study of Parallel Derivative Suits,"Stephen J. Choi, Jessica Erickson, A. C. Pritchard","Using a sample of all companies named as defendants in securities class actions between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008, we study parallel suits relying on state corporate law arising out of the same allegations as the securities class actions. We test several ways that parallel suits may add value to a securities class action. Most parallel suits target cases involving obvious indicia of wrongdoing. Moreover, we find that although a modest percentage of parallel suits are filed first, over 80 percent are filed after a securities class action (termed “follow-on” parallel suits). We find that parallel suits and, in particular, follow-on parallel suits sometimes target individual officers not already named as defendants in the securities class action. Suing more officers, however, does not positively correlate with an increase in settlement incidence, monetary recovery amounts, or attorney fees. Parallel suits sometimes result in settlements when the corresponding class action is dismissed; however, only rarely do the parallel suit settlements provide monetary recovery for investors. We find that follow-on parallel suits often result in nonmonetary, corporate governance settlements, particularly for frequent-filing plaintiffs’ attorneys. Corporate governance settlements correlate with significantly lower attorney hours and attorney fees for the plaintiffs’ attorneys. We conclude that such settlements are used to justify fees in cases in which there is no monetary recovery.",07 November 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 4", 653-682,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12160
140,Triaging the Law: Developing the Common Law on the Supreme Court of India,"Andrew Green, Albert H. Yoon","Legal precedent serves as the foundation of the common law. Judges provide their reasoning through precedent, citing cases to support their conclusion while distinguishing between cases cited by that counsel in favor of an opposing result. Legal precedent also provides the mechanism by which judges communicate with one another, at the same time providing guidance to prospective litigants and the practicing bar. This process is particularly important for supreme courts, whose decisions bind all lower courts within their jurisdiction. For this reason, in most common-law jurisdictions, the supreme court decides relatively few cases but draws heavily on precedent for the opinions it issues. The Supreme Court in India stands in contrast to its counterparts in countries such as the United States and Canada in that it decides thousands, rather than tens, of cases. Examining the universe of Court decisions from 1950–2010, we find that the Court elects not to cite precedent in nearly half its opinions. In turn, these opinions without citation to precedent are rarely subsequently cited. However, there is a second set of decisions that is more analogous to U.S. Supreme Court decisions. These decisions do cite prior decisions and are cited by later cases. Opinions that do cite precedent gravitate to older opinions, whose salience often endures for decades. These findings suggest the Court is constrained in its ability to process a heavy caseload, and makes strategic decisions as to which opinions to emphasize through its use of precedent.",07 November 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 4", 683-715,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12161
141,Religion and Judging on the Federal Courts of Appeals,"Sepehr Shahshahani, Lawrence J. Liu","We construct a database of federal appellate cases involving religious liberties decided between 2006 and 2015, expanding and improving an existing database covering up to 2005. The data are used to investigate the role of religion in judicial decision making. We find that Jewish judges are significantly more likely than their non-Jewish colleagues to favor claimants in religious liberties cases, but we find no significant effects for other minority religions. Our findings confirm previous findings in the literature, but we go a number of steps further than existing studies in uncovering the sources of Jewish judges’ influence. We conclude that the effect of Jewish judges comes through their increased concern for the separation of church and state—not through their heightened solicitude for the interests of religious minorities in practicing their religion or through preferential treatment of Jewish claimants. Further, our analysis of cases not involving religion shows that the pro-claimant effect of Jewish judges is attributable not to a general liberal attitude but to a particular secular concern for the separation of church and state. Finally, we are the first researchers to go beyond individual effects and investigate the panel effects of judges’ religious affiliation. Our findings in this regard have suggestive implications for identifying the mechanism of panel effects.",07 November 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 4", 716-744,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12162
142,Moral Disengagement in Legal Judgments,"Tess M. S. Neal, Robert J. Cramer","We investigated the role of moral disengagement in a legally-relevant judgment in this theoretically-driven empirical analysis. Moral disengagement is a social-cognitive phenomenon through which people reason their way toward harming others, presenting a useful framework for investigating legal judgments that often result in harming individuals for the good of society. We tested the role of moral disengagement in forensic psychologists’ willingness to conduct the most ethically questionable clinical task in the criminal justice system: competence for execution evaluations. Our hypothesis that moral disengagement would function as mediator of participants’ existing attitudes and their judgments—a theoretical “bridge” between attitudes and judgments—was robustly supported. Moral disengagement was key to understanding how psychologists decide to engage in competence for execution evaluations. We describe in detail the moral disengagement measure we used, including exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses across two separate samples. The four-factor measure accounted for a total of 52.18 percent of the variance in the sample of forensic psychologists, and the model adequately fit the data in the entirely different sample of jurors in a confirmatory factor analysis. Despite the psychometric strengths of this moral disengagement measure, we describe the pros and cons of existing measures of moral disengagement. We outline future directions for moral disengagement research, especially in legal contexts.",07 November 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 4", 745-761,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12163
143,Choice Architecture Versus Price: Comparing the Effects of Changes in the U.S. Student Loan Market,"Xiaoling Ang, Alexei Alexandrov","We show that changes in choice architecture have a large effect on student loan decisions while we do not find significant effects of sizeable interest rate changes. We evaluate the effect of two polices implemented in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Education: (1) the requirement that all applicants for private student loans fill out a Self-Certification Form, which includes various disclosures about federal student aid, and (2) the prohibition of presenting a private student loan as a default option on a financial aid offer without disclosure of the relationship between the school and the creditor. Using difference-in-difference and matching techniques on a proprietary dataset of private student loan originations from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and survey and administrative data from the Department of Education, we show that these changes decreased private student loan originations. In contrast, we find no consumer response when analyzing a 60 basis point decrease in the price of federal Parental PLUS Loans at some schools, using the same datasets and similar estimation techniques.",07 November 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 4", 762-812,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12164
144,The Politics of Citations at the ECJ—Policy Preferences of E.U. Member State Governments and the Citation Behavior of Judges at the European Court of Justice,Jens Frankenreiter,"This article investigates the relationship between the political preferences of E.U. Member States and the behavior of judges at the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by analyzing their citation behavior. It shows that judges at the ECJ are more likely to cite judgments authored by judges appointed by Member State governments with similar preferences regarding European integration. Analogous with the context of U.S. courts, nonrandom opinion assignment potentially threatens the validity of these results. To overcome this problem, I exploit the unique institutional setting at the ECJ to develop an improved identification strategy that builds on comparing the citations in two documents produced in the same case (i.e., the judgment and the opinion of the Advocate General). The findings in this article provide evidence for the hypothesis that the political preferences of Member State governments are reflected in the behavior of the members of the ECJ.",07 November 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 4", 813-857,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12165
145,Insuring Your Donation: An Experiment,"Renate Buijze, Christoph Engel, Sigrid Hemels","An increasing fraction of donations is channeled through donation intermediaries. These entities serve multiple purposes, one of which seems to be providing donors with greater certainty: that the donation reaches its intended goal, and that the donor may be sure to receive a tax benefit. We interpret this function as insurance and test the option to insure donations in the lab. Our participants indeed have a positive willingness to pay for insurance against either contingency. Yet the insurance option is only critical for their willingness to donate to a charity if the risk affects the proper use of their donation. Participants have a higher willingness to pay for insurance if, in case the risk materializes, they receive their money back. With this design of the insurance, almost no participant wants to donate if she is not insured.",07 November 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 4", 858-885,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12166

Interim Settlement Funding Corporation,Jean Xiao,"Consumer litigation funding, a growing industry in the United States, is an alternative credit source for cash-strapped tort plaintiffs. Financiers give plaintiffs nonrecourse loans that are premised on lawsuit outcomes. This article is the first to empirically examine the effect of consumer litigation funding. Specifically, I explore the impact of nonrecourse loans on medical malpractice litigation outcomes by exploiting the variation in timing and geography from two Ohio policy changes: the Ohio Supreme Court's 2003 ban of funding in Rancman v. Interim Settlement Funding Corporation and the state's subsequent legislative legalization of funding in 2008.

148,The Effects of Twombly and Iqbal,William H. J. Hubbard,"Ever since Twombly and Iqbal introduced the doctrine of plausibility pleading, a cottage industry of legal scholars (including myself) has undertaken to detect the effects of Twombly and Iqbal on litigants and case outcomes. Results so far have been equivocal, and it has been hard to make sense of the disparate methodologies and findings. In this article, I develop a comprehensive yet nontechnical framework for empirically testing the effects of Twombly and Iqbal on lower courts and litigants, taking into account a wide range of confounding factors and the numerous ways in which Twombly and Iqbal may have indirectly affected litigant behavior. Using this framework, I test for effects of Twombly and Iqbal on district court and litigant behavior using two datasets—one of administrative data covering over 700,000 cases, and one of detailed, hand- and machine-coded docket and complaint data covering a representative sample of nearly 2,000 cases. I also review existing findings. I find only limited evidence that Twombly and Iqbal, the two most important pleading cases in 50 years, have had a major effect on the behavior of lawyers and judges across all cases. For represented plaintiffs, rates of dismissal with prejudice have held steady, motions to dismiss remain uncommon, and settlement and filing patterns have not changed appreciably in the wake of Twombly and Iqbal. There is, however, some evidence of effects—potentially major effects—on pro se plaintiffs. Further, while case outcomes for represented plaintiffs have been largely unaffected by Twombly and Iqbal, there is evidence that lawyers changed their pleading and motion practice in the wake of those cases.",07 August 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 3", 474-526,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12153
149,Unbundling Efficient Breach: An Experiment,"Maria Bigoni, Stefania Bortolotti, Francesco Parisi, Ariel Porat","Current law and economics scholarship analyzes efficient breach cases monolithically. The standard analysis holds that breach is efficient when performance of a contract generates a negative total surplus for the parties. However, by simplistically grouping efficient breach cases as of a single kind, the prior literature overlooks that gain-seeking breaches might be different from loss-avoiding breaches. To capture these different motives, we designed a novel game called the Contract-Breach Game where we exogenously varied the reasons for the breach—pursuing a gain or avoiding a loss—under a specific performance remedy. Results from an incentivized laboratory experiment indicate that the motives behind the breach induce sizable differences in behavior; subjects are less willing to renegotiate when facing gain-seeking than loss-avoiding breaches, and the compensation premium obtained by the promisee is higher. Our analysis suggests that inequality aversion is an important driver of our results; indeed, inequality-averse subjects accept low offers more often in cases of loss-avoiding breaches than gain-seeking breaches. These results give us insight into the preferences and expectations of ordinary people in a case of a breach.",07 August 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 3", 527-547,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12154

151,Evaluating Negative Forensic Evidence: When Do Jurors Treat Absence of Evidence as Evidence of Absence?,"William C. Thompson, Nicholas Scurich, Rachel Dioso-Villa, Brenda Velazquez","Two jury simulation experiments tested participants’ sensitivity to variations in the probative value of a piece of negative forensic evidence: failure to find gunshot residue (GSR) on a defendant alleged to have fired a gun. Experiment 1 found that if no GSR was detected, juries (N = 115) of undergraduates were appropriately less likely to convict a criminal defendant when the probability of detecting GSR was high than when it was low. Participants were unaffected by contextualizing expert testimony that emphasized either the value of the negative evidence for making inductive inferences or that the negative evidence was inconclusive for making deductions. Experiment 2 used a sample of venire jurors (N = 420) and manipulated the probability of detecting GSR (0 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent, 90 percent, or 100 percent) given that a gun was fired. Consistent with the first experiment, venire jurors were more likely to convict when the probability of detection was 0 percent or 50 percent than when it was 100 percent, but verdicts did not differ between the middle groups. This pattern of results suggests that jurors may evaluate negative evidence according to a fairly crude metric—giving it no weight if the probability of detection is zero, a great deal of weight if the probability of detection is 100 percent, and moderate weight if the probability of detection is somewhere in between.",07 August 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 3", 569-591,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12156

Nelson","To what degree is the legitimacy of the U.S. Supreme Court currently at risk? Perhaps the most widely accepted view of how the Supreme Court acquires and maintains its legitimacy is positivity theory, which claims that the legitimizing symbols of judicial authority protect the Court's legitimacy from dissatisfaction with its rulings. Although research has shown that belief in legal realism does not itself threaten the Court's legitimacy, positivity theory suggests that portrayals of the Court as embroiled in politics—that is, as “just another political institution”—can undermine institutional legitimacy. Still, some recent research recognizes that ideological disagreement poses a serious threat to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. Missing from extant literature is a reconciliation of how these three determinants—ideological dissatisfaction, legal realism, and perceptions of judicial politicization—combine to structure judicial legitimacy. Understanding the difference between perceptions of an “ideological” Court versus a “politicized” Court for institutional legitimacy is our central purpose in this article. We discover that the greatest threats to the Court's legitimacy lie in beliefs that judges are just ordinary politicians (not in ideological dissatisfaction or legal realism). We conclude by drawing out these findings’ implications for the upcoming highly politicized battles over nominations to the high bench.",07 August 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 3", 592-617,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12157

Havasy","This article examines the negative effect fallacy, a flawed statistical argument first utilized by the Warren Court in Elkins v. United States. The Court argued that empirical evidence could not determine whether the exclusionary rule prevents future illegal searches and seizures because “it is never easy to prove a negative,” inappropriately conflating the philosophical and arithmetic definitions of the word negative. Subsequently, the Court has repeated this mistake in other domains, including free speech, voting rights, and campaign finance. The fallacy has also proliferated into the federal circuit and district court levels. Narrowly, our investigation aims to eradicate the use of the negative effect fallacy in federal courts. More broadly, we highlight several challenges and concerns with the increasing use of statistical reasoning in court decisions. As courts continue to evaluate statistical and empirical questions, we recommend that they evaluate the evidence on its own merit rather than relying on convenient arguments embedded in precedent.",07 August 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 3", 618-647,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12158

We find that unemployment levels at graduation continue to predict law earnings premiums within four years after graduation for earners at the high end and middle of the distribution. However, the relation fades as law graduates gain experience and the difference in lifetime earnings is moderate. Outcomes data available prior to matriculation do not predict unemployment or starting salaries at graduation. Earnings premiums are not predicted by BLS projected job openings. Although changes in cohort size predict changes in the percent of law graduates practicing law, we find little evidence that changes in cohort size predict changes in earnings. This suggests that law graduates who switch to other occupations when law cohort sizes increase are not hurt financially by larger cohorts. For medium- to high-earning graduates, successfully timing law school predicts a higher value of a law degree ex-post, but simulations show that no strategy for ex-ante timing is readily available.",25 April 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 2", 258-300,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12147

Wedig","Empirical research on medical malpractice liability has largely ignored incentives to restructure to protect assets. This study provides evidence on asset shielding in the nursing home industry. There was a rapid increase in lawsuits alleging patient neglect or abuse in states with plaintiff-friendly tort environments beginning in the second half of the 1990s. We document two apparent asset-shielding trends in these states during the 1998–2004 period: (1) sales of homes by large chains to smaller, more judgment-proof owners; and (2) a reduced propensity to “brand” chain-owned units with names that linked them directly to the central corporation or sister units. Twelve states enacted tort reforms during the 2003–2006 period that placed caps on noneconomic damages. Using a difference-in-differences (DD) methodology, we find that the trends in asset-shielding behavior abated or reversed in the states that enacted tort reforms. These findings suggest that tort law affects ownership and other organizational choices in this industry.",25 April 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 2", 301-332,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12148
157,The Standard of Proof in the Substantiation of Child Abuse and Neglect,"Nicholas E. Kahn, Josh Gupta-Kagan, Mary Eschelbach Hansen","We measure the extent to which requiring a high standard of proof for substantiation of child abuse or neglect by child protection agencies actually influences the disposition of a report of abuse or neglect. Using data on nearly 8 million reports from fiscal 2000–2012, we show that a high standard is associated with lower rates of substantiation and that an increase in the standard decreases the probability of substantiation by up to 14 percent. After a change to a high standard, children may be less likely to be placed in foster care, and children and families are more likely to receive other types of services. Increases in the standard seem to be driven by perceptions of the costs of Type 1 error—that is, substantiating a report when no abuse occurred. Indeed, states’ decisions to increase the standard are strongly correlated with fatalities in foster care and the size of the foster care system, suggesting that public concern about Type 1 error leading to overly invasive child protection agency action can spur a shift in the standard of proof.",25 April 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 2", 333-369,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12149

A primary goal of this legislation was to lessen the harshness of sentences for crack cocaine offenders and decrease the sentencing gap between crack defendants and powder cocaine defendants. While the mean sentence length for crack offenders fell following the implementation of the FSA, these changes appear to primarily reflect the continuation of ongoing sentencing trends that were initiated by a variety of noncongressional reforms to federal sentencing policy that commenced around 2007. However, the FSA appears to have been helpful in allowing these trends to continue past 2010.",25 April 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 2", 370-396,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12150
159,Do Credit-Based Insurance Scores Proxy for Income in Predicting Auto Claim Risk?,"Darcy Steeg Morris, Daniel Schwarcz, Joshua C. Teitelbaum","Property and casualty insurers often use credit-based insurance scores in their underwriting and rating processes. The practice is controversial—many consumer groups oppose it, and most states regulate it, in part out of concern that insurance scores proxy for policyholder income in predicting claim risk. We offer new evidence on this issue in the context of auto insurance. Prior studies on the subject suffer from the limitation that they rely solely on aggregate measures of income, such as the median income in a policyholder's census tract or zip code. We analyze a panel of households that purchased auto and home policies from a U.S. insurance company. Because we observe the households’ home policies as well as their auto policies, we are able to employ two measures of income: the median income in a household's census tract, an aggregate measure, and the insured value of the household's dwelling, a policyholder-level measure. Using these measures, we find that insurance scores do not proxy for income in a standard actuarial model of auto claim risk.",25 April 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 2", 397-423,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12151

States account for the majority of civil litigation, yet they are understudied doctrinally and empirically. When we consider pleading at the state level, we can leverage differences across space and time in a way that is impossible with studies of federal courts. Using an array of principled empirical approaches on the best available data, we find no evidence that raising pleading standards affected plaintiff behavior. We observe no decrease in filings and no significant change in complaint length, number of claims, or number of amended complaints. For defense strategy and judicial responses, we find no increase in motions to dismiss and no increase in the grant rate on motions to dismiss, though these findings are more tentative, given data limitations. We conduct our analysis by comparing Nebraska, a state that raised its pleading standards, with as many as 12 comparison states, none of which raised their pleading standards over the years 2006–2013.",25 April 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 2", 424-469,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12152

163,Unintended Consequences: The Regressive Effects of Increased Access to Courts,"Anthony Niblett, Albert H. Yoon","Small claims courts enable parties to resolve their disputes relatively quickly and cheaply. The court's limiting feature, by design, is that alleged damages must be small, in accordance with the jurisdictional limit at that time. Accordingly, one might expect that a large increase in the upper limit of claim size would increase the court's accessibility to a larger and potentially more diverse pool of litigants. We examine this proposition by studying the effect of an increase in the jurisdictional limit of the Ontario Small Claims Court. Prior to January 2010, claims up to $10,000 could be litigated in the small claims court. After January 2010, this jurisdictional limit increased to include all claims up to $25,000. We study patterns in nearly 625,000 disputes over the period 2006–2013. In this article, we investigate plaintiff behavior. Interestingly, the total number of claims filed by plaintiffs does not increase significantly with the increased jurisdictional limit. We do find, however, changes to the composition of plaintiffs. Following the jurisdictional change, we find that plaintiffs using the small claims court are, on average, from richer neighborhoods. We also find that the proportion of plaintiffs from poorer neighborhoods drops. The drop-off is most pronounced in plaintiffs from the poorest 10 percent of neighborhoods. We explore potential explanations for this regressive effect, including crowding out, congestion, increased legal representation, and behavioral influences. Our findings suggest that legislative attempts to make the courts more accessible may have unintended regressive consequences.",20 February 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 1", 5-30,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12140
164,The Private Ordering Solution to Multiforum Shareholder Litigation,"Roberta Romano, Sarath Sanga","This article analyzes a private ordering solution to multiforum shareholder litigation: exclusive forum provisions in corporate charters and bylaws. These provisions require that all corporate-law-related disputes be brought in a single forum, typically a court in the statutory domicile. Using hand-collected data on the 746 U.S. public corporations that have adopted the provision, we examine what drives the growth in these provisions and whether, as some critics contend, their adoption reflects managerial opportunism. We find that nearly all new Delaware corporations adopt the provision at the IPO stage, and that the transition from zero to near-universal IPO adoption over 2007–2014 is driven by law firms. Characteristics of individual companies appear to play little or no role in adoption decisions. Instead, the pattern of adoption follows what can be described as a light-switch model, in which law firms suddenly switch from never adopting to always adopting the provision in the IPOs they advise. For post-IPO (or “midstream”) adoptions, we compare corporate governance features of adopters to a matched sample of nonadopters to test the hypothesis that midstream bylaw adoption reflects managerial opportunism. If the hypothesis were correct, then we would expect to find that the midstream adopters exhibit poor corporate governance compared to nonadopters (using the metrics of good governance practices as identified by critics of the provisions). We find, however, that there are either no significant differences in governance or that it is adopters that have higher-quality governance features. We also find no significant differences in governance and ownership structures between firms whose boards adopt the provisions as bylaws and those who obtain shareholder approval. The absence of significant differences across firms using disparate adoption procedures suggests that the method of adopting an exclusive forum provision—whether with or without shareholder approval—should not be a matter of import for investors.",20 February 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 1", 31-78,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12141
165,Voting But for the Law: Evidence from Virginia on Photo Identification Requirements,"Daniel J. Hopkins, Marc Meredith, Michael Morse, Sarah Smith, Jesse Yoder","One contentious question in contemporary election administration is the impact of voter identification requirements. We study a Virginia law that allows us to isolate the impact of requiring voters to show photo identification. Using novel, precinct-level data, we find that the percentage of registered voters without a driver's license and over age 85 are both positively associated with the number of provisional ballots cast due to a lack of a photo ID. To examine the law's impact on turnout, we associate precinct-level demographics with the change in turnout between the 2013 gubernatorial and 2014 midterm elections. All else equal, turnout was higher in places where more active registered voters lacked a driver's license. This unexpected relationship might be explained by a targeted Department of Elections mailing, suggesting that the initial impact of voter ID laws may hinge on efforts to notify voters likely to be affected.",20 February 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 1", 79-128,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12142
166,The Prudent Investor Rule and Market Risk: An Empirical Analysis,"Max M. Schanzenbach, Robert H. Sitkoff","The prudent investor rule, enacted in every state over the last 30 years, is the centerpiece of trust investment law. Repudiating the prior law's emphasis on avoiding risk, the rule reorients trust investment toward risk management in accordance with modern portfolio theory. The rule directs a trustee to implement an overall investment strategy having risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the trust. Using data from reports of bank trust holdings and fiduciary income tax returns, we examine asset allocation and management of market risk before and after the reform. First, we find that the reform increased stockholdings, but not among banks with average trust account sizes below the 25th percentile. This result is consistent with sensitivity in asset allocation to trust risk tolerance. Second, we present evidence consistent with increased portfolio rebalancing after the reform. We conclude that the move toward additional stockholdings was correlated with trust risk tolerance, and that the increased market risk exposure from additional stockholdings was more actively managed.",20 February 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 1", 129-168,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12143
167,Auditor Settlements of Securities Class Actions,James J. Park,"Some corporate law scholars have concluded that auditors do not have sufficient legal incentive to detect securities fraud and should be governed by a strict liability standard. This study assesses this argument by examining a dataset of 554 class actions alleging an accounting restatement filed from 1996 through 2007. Because some but not all of these restatement cases named an auditor defendant, it is possible to analyze whether variables such as the liability standard affect both the decision to name an auditor defendant as well as the outcome of the case. Despite the narrowing of auditor liability under Rule 10b-5, auditors are still often named as defendants and pay substantial settlements in Rule 10b-5 cases. A more restrictive liability standard is associated with a modest reduction in the rate at which auditors are named as defendants and the rate at which auditor cases end in settlement. If a Rule 10b-5 case against an auditor is strong enough to result in a settlement, the legal standard does not affect the size of the settlement. The auditor's payment is correlated with nonlegal factors such as whether the issuer is bankrupt and the issuer's market capitalization. These results are best explained by the tendency of judges to read narrow liability provisions broadly in cases where the size and impact of the alleged fraud are significant. The evidence thus does not support the conclusion that a strict liability standard is necessary to generate sufficient incentives for auditors to detect substantial frauds.",20 February 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 1", 169-198,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12144
168,Pain and Suffering Damages in Personal Injury Cases: An Empirical Study,"Yun-chien Chang, Theodore Eisenberg, Tsung Hsien Li, Martin T. Wells","Many jurisdictions award pain and suffering damages, yet it is difficult for judges or juries to quantify pain. Several jurisdictions, such as California, cap pain and suffering damages or other noneconomic damages, and legal scholars have proposed ways to control such damages. Reforms and proposals, however, have been based on limited empirical evidence. It remains an open question whether components of economic damages explain pain and suffering damages. This study employs a unique dataset of Taiwan district court cases and uses detailed information on the components of pecuniary damages. Pain and suffering damages highly correlate with the plaintiff's medical expenses, level of injury, and the amount requested by the plaintiff. The association with the amount requested by the plaintiff persists when one accounts for the likely quantifiable influences on pain and suffering damages, evidence of a possible anchoring effect. The strong correlation between economic damages and noneconomic damages persists in a large U.S. dataset of judge and jury trials, in which the noneconomic fraction of total damages is no greater than the pain and suffering fraction of total damages in Taiwan. Judges and juries consistently produce coherent patterns of noneconomic damages.",20 February 2017,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 14, Issue 1", 199-237,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12145

174,The Predicates of Military Detention at Guantánamo: The Role of Individual Acts and Affiliations,Aziz Z. Huq,"The military detentions at Guantánamo have provoked intense controversy. Judges, legislators, and military officials disagree sharply about the scope of detention authority. To date, little is known about the granular determinants of decisions to transfer detainees from custody at the Cuban base or to prolong their detention. This article exploits a novel data set of classified documents disclosed by the Wikileaks organization to explore two questions now dividing officials, legislators, and judges. First, what are the detainee actions and affiliations that predict longer detentions? Second, what is the relationship between a determination that a detainee committed certain acts and the further inference of affiliation with a proscribed terrorist organization? These inquiries isolate both continuities and divergences from the law “on the books.”",17 November 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 4", 567-602,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12126
175,Medical Malpractice Litigation and the Market for Plaintiff-Side Representation: Evidence from Illinois,"David A. Hyman, Mohammad Rahmati, Bernard S. Black, Charles Silver","How concentrated is the market for medical malpractice (med mal) legal representation? Do successful plaintiffs’ lawyers start off with better cases to begin with, do they add more value to the cases they handle, or both? How do top plaintiffs’ lawyers market their services, and where did they go to school? How large are the “wages of risk”—the compensation to plaintiffs’ lawyers for working on contingency? How often do plaintiffs proceed pro se, and with what results? We address these questions using a data set of every insured med mal case closed in Illinois during 2000–2010. We show that most plaintiffs have a lawyer. We quantify the market share, case mix, and amounts recovered by the 1,317 law firms that handled med mal cases in our sample, stratify the firms into four tiers, and assess differences across tiers. We find that the market for plaintiff-side med mal representation is both unconcentrated and highly stratified. At all firms, a small number of cases account for a heavily disproportionate share of total recoveries. We use the extensive covariates in our data to (imperfectly) address sample selection, and to estimate the effect of having a lawyer and law firm tier on outcomes. Controlling for observable claim characteristics, having a lawyer predicts a large increase in the probability of prevailing and the estimated recovery. Higher-tier firms have only modestly higher success rates, but substantially higher estimated recoveries. However, the differences shrink and are statistically insignificant when we compare first-tier to second-tier firms. This suggests that there are substantial benefits to having a lawyer—and a higher-tier lawyer—but diminishing marginal returns at the top of the market. Assuming that there is some unobserved case selection, our findings provide a plausible upper bound on the “value added” by different tiers of plaintiffs’ lawyers.",17 November 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 4", 603-636,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12127
176,Legal and Extralegal Origins of Sentencing Disparities: Evidence from Russia's Criminal Courts,Vadim Volkov,"This article conducts the first analysis of sentencing disparities related to social characteristics of offenders in Russia. It uses a data set of sentencing decisions consisting of over 5 million observations representing the entire population of defendants between 2009 and 2013. The analysis focuses on all felony cases processed by federal district courts (2,905,608 individuals) and estimates sentencing disparities (decisions to imprison and sentence length) related to general social status characteristics of offenders as well as to finer occupational differences. The Russian Criminal Code prescribes that judges should account for the personality of the defendant and his or her family condition, but does not specify how this should be done in practice. Controlling for major legal characteristics of offense and offender, as well as for judge-level variation, the analysis shows sentencing disparities connected with gender, unemployment, citizenship, local residence, marital status, and occupational status of defendants. Disparities are explained with reference to different origins. Thus, a more severe punishment of law enforcement employees for premeditated crimes corresponds to the legal rule; a harsher treatment of the unemployed and a more lenient sentencing of married defendants are interpreted with reference to legitimate concerns about repeated offending. Extralegal bias is manifested in the more severe punishment of private entrepreneurs and softer punishment of college students. Sentencing disparities are also estimated at different values of sentence length.",17 November 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 4", 637-665,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12128
177,Are Arbitrators Human?,"Rebecca K. Helm, Andrew J. Wistrich, Jeffrey J. Rachlinski","Empirical research has confirmed the correctness of the legal realists’ assertion that “judges are human.” It demonstrates that judicial decisions are sometimes tainted by bias, ideology, or error. Presumably, arbitrators are “human” in that sense too, but that conclusion does not necessarily follow. Although arbitrators and judges both umpire disputes, they differ in a variety of ways. Therefore, it is possible that arbitrators’ awards are either better or worse than judges’ decisions. This article reports the results of research conducted on elite arbitrators specializing in resolving commercial disputes. Our goal was to determine whether, like judges, arbitrators are subject to three common cognitive illusions—specifically, the conjunction fallacy, the framing effect, and the confirmation bias. We also wanted to find out whether, like judges, arbitrators exhibit a tendency to rely excessively on intuition that may exacerbate the impact of cognitive illusions on their decision making. Our results reveal that “arbitrators are human,” and indicate that arbitrators perform about the same as judges in experiments designed to detect the presence of common cognitive errors and excessive reliance on intuition. This suggests that arbitrators lack an inherent advantage over judges when it comes to making high-quality decisions. Whether the situation in which arbitrators make their awards is more conducive to sound decision making than the setting in which judges make their rulings, however, remains unclear.",17 November 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 4", 666-692,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12129
178,Intuitive Jurisprudence: Early Reasoning About the Functions of Punishment,"Jessica Bregant, Alex Shaw, Katherine D. Kinzler","Traditional research on lay beliefs about punishment is often hampered by the complex nature of the question and its implications. We present a new intuitive jurisprudence approach that utilizes the insights of developmental psychology to shed light on the origins of punishment intuitions, along with the first empirical study to test the approach. Data from 80 child participants are presented, providing evidence that children expect punishment to serve as a specific deterrent, but finding no evidence that children expect punishment to have a general deterrent or rehabilitative effect. We also find that children understand punishment in a way that is consistent with the expressive theory of law and with expressive retributivism, and we present evidence that an understanding of the value of punishment to the social contract develops throughout childhood. Finally, we discuss the application of the intuitive jurisprudence approach to other important legal questions.",17 November 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 4", 693-717,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12130
179,The Effect of Tort Reform on Medical Malpractice Insurance Market Trends,"Patricia H. Born, J. Bradley Karl","In this article, we examine the extent to which the timing of reforms to the tort liability system coincides with changes in medical malpractice insurance market conditions. Our research is motivated by the fact that, while policy discussions and academic research pertaining to the merits of tort reform often center on ex post effects, it is unclear whether reforms to the tort liability system are responsible for softening conditions in a medical malpractice insurance market that was previously deteriorating. Our analysis of tort reforms in the mid-2000s finds little evidence that state-level medical malpractice insurance losses incurred, premiums earned, or incurred loss ratios were increasing in the years immediately prior to the enactment of various tort reforms, making it difficult to attribute the observed softening of the medical malpractice insurance market that occurred in the mid to late 2000s to the enactment of tort reforms. Our conclusion is that, while tort reforms are effective policy tools for lowering levels of medical malpractice insurance losses incurred and improving insurer profitability, there is little evidence to suggest that reforms are an effective method for softening a medical malpractice insurance marketplace that is otherwise steadily deteriorating.",17 November 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 4", 718-755,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12131
180,Differential Access to Capital from Financial Institutions by Minority Entrepreneurs,Darius Palia,"This article examines whether minority small business borrowers have the same access to loans from financial institutions as similar white borrowers. Using matching methods, I find that African-American borrowers are rejected at an approximately 30 percent higher probability than similar white borrowers. I also find that the impact of unobservable variables has to be greater than 85 percent the impact of observable variables to show no discrimination. This bound seems to be a high number given that I have controlled for a large number of borrower, firm, and lender characteristics. No such differential effect is found for Asian and other minority borrowers. I also find equal expected default losses between African-American and white borrowers. These results are consistent with the information-based, laissez faire, and group hoarding theories of discrimination, and against the taste-based theory of discrimination.",17 November 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 4", 756-785,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12132
181,Formal and Social Enforcement in Response to Individual Versus Corporate Transgressions,"Uriel Haran, Doron Teichman, Yuval Feldman","Social enforcement of norms governing appropriate business practices, through online and social networks, is regarded as an effective alternative to formal, state-sponsored enforcement. However, recent research finds that such norms are interpreted differently when applied to individual actors than when applied to corporations. This article finds that this difference transcends to enforcement, and that willingness to actively respond to a transgression depends on both the transgressor's identity and the type of violation. Three studies found that people are reluctant to substitute social enforcement for state-sponsored action, and that the preference for formal over social action was generally more pronounced when the target of the action was an individual than when the action targeted a corporation. Furthermore, individuals were judged more severely for intentional harms, whereas corporations received higher levels of critique for violations caused by negligent behavior. Our findings suggest that the state may need to exercise caution in outsourcing norm enforcement in commercial relationships.",17 November 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 4", 786-808,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12133
182,Homeowner Representation in the Foreclosure Crisis,Emily S. Taylor Poppe,"The dramatic increase in the number of homeowners entering the foreclosure process over the past decade has been well documented. While some of these cases end in foreclosure, many homeowners are able to secure alternate outcomes. There is reason to believe that legal representation may help homeowners to achieve more favorable outcomes. However, other aspects of the foreclosure process, particularly those instituted to increase court oversight and homeowner participation, may circumscribe the benefits of legal representation. In this article, I investigate whether homeowners with legal representation are more likely to avoid foreclosure than those who are unrepresented, taking into account procedural reforms that might shape the effectiveness of legal representation. Using a representative sample of residential foreclosure cases initiated in New York City between 2007 and 2011, I find that cases where the homeowner has legal representation less frequently end in foreclosure. However, after accounting for the enactment of reforms to the foreclosure process, the probability of foreclosure is not significantly different for cases where the homeowner has legal representation. The results suggest that the characteristics of the foreclosure process may be consequential for the resolution of foreclosure cases and the benefit of legal representation. This research contributes to scholarship on the use and effect of lawyers by considering the role of legal representation for homeowners facing foreclosure in the context of the rapid social and economic changes of the Great Recession.",17 November 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 4", 809-836,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12134

Spiller, Sebastian Stolorz","We apply algorithmic data reading and textual analysis to compare the features of contracts in regulated industries subject to public scrutiny (which we call “public contracts”) with contracts between nongovernmental entities. We show that public contracts are lengthier and have more rule-based rigid clauses; in addition, their renegotiation is formalized in amendments. We also find that contract length and the frequency of rigidity clauses increases in political contestability and closer to upcoming elections. We maintain that the higher rigidity of public contracts is a political risk adaptation strategy carried out by public agents to lower the likelihood of success of politically-motivated challenges from opportunistic third parties.",08 August 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 3", 396-427,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12119
187,Academic Tenure,Albert H. Yoon,"In academia, a subset of faculty has tenure, which allows its beneficiaries to retain their professorships without mandatory retirement and with only limited grounds for revocation. Proponents of tenure argue it protects intellectual freedom and encourages investment in human capital. Detractors contend it discourages effort and distorts the academic labor market. This article develops a framework for examining academic tenure in the context of U.S. law schools. We construct a unique data set of tenured U.S. law professors who began their careers between 1993 through 2002, and follow their employment and scholarship for the first 10 years of their career. Across all journal publications, tenured faculty publish more frequently, are cited with roughly the same frequency, and place in comparable caliber of journal. These productivity gains, however, largely disappear when excluding solicited publications. These results suggest that legal academics continue to produce after tenure, but channel more of their efforts toward less competitive outlets.",08 August 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 3", 428-453,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12120

We separately estimate these rates for district court and appeals court decisions. We find multiple structural breaks in both validity and infringement, and the breaks do not coincide. The rate of validity falls around 1939 and rises around 1983, while the rate of infringement rises around 1950 and falls around 1991. We argue that these breaks, and the variation across the implied five “eras” of decision standards, reflect political and legal innovations.",08 August 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 3", 454-486,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12121
189,Nuclear Power and the Mob: Extortion in Japan,J. Mark Ramseyer,"Nuclear reactors entail massive nontransferrable site-specific investments. The resulting appropriable quasi-rents offer the mob a lucrative target. In exchange for large fees, it can either promise to “protect” the utility (and silence the reactor's local opponents) or “extort” from it (and desist from inciting those opponents). Using prefecture-level Japanese panel data covering the years 1980 to 2010, I find that extortion rates rise when a utility announces plans to build a reactor. The evidence is consistent with a straightforward account: once news about a utility's plans to build a new reactor leaks, the mob moves in to appropriate the large quasi-rents from the utility, and stays to do what it does everywhere else—extort regular payments from local businesses.",08 August 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 3", 487-515,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12122
190,Revisiting Eisenberg and Plaintiff Success: State Court Civil Trial and Appellate Outcomes,"Michael Heise, Martin T. Wells","Despite what Priest-Klein theory predicts, in earlier research on federal civil cases, Eisenberg found an association between plaintiff success in pretrial motions and at trial. Our extension of Eisenberg's analysis 20 years later into the state court context, however, does not uncover any statistically significant association between a plaintiff's success at trial and preserving that trial victory on appeal. Our results imply that a plaintiff's decision to pursue litigation to a trial court conclusion is analytically distinct from the plaintiff's decision to defend an appeal of its trial court win brought by a disgruntled defendant. We consider various factors that likely account for the observed differences that distinguish our results from Eisenberg's. First, legal cases that persist to an appellate outcome are a filtered subset of underlying trials and legal disputes and various selection effects inform much of this case filtering. Second, where Eisenberg analyzed the relation between pretrial motions and trial outcomes in federal courts, we assess possible relations between trial and appellate court outcomes in state courts. The pretrial and trial context and the trial and appeals context likely differ in ways that disturb plaintiff success. Third, while Eisenberg studied federal cases between 1978–1985 we study state cases between 2001–2009. In addition to differences between federal and state civil cases, the composition of cases that selected into formal litigation may have evolved over time.",08 August 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 3", 516-535,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12123
191,"He Paid, She Paid: Exploiting Israeli Courts' Rulings on Litigation Costs to Explore Gender Biases","Talia Fisher, Tamar Kricheli-Katz, Issi Rosen-Zvi, Theodore Eisenberg","This study documents gender disparities in litigation-cost rulings in Israel. It expands on the existing literature on judicial bias in at least two important ways: by controlling for the merits of the cases and by focusing on civil litigation. The first improvement is methodological. The unique Israeli regime of litigation costs allows us to control for the merit of the cases, as well as for other typically unobservable variables, and thus to isolate and observe judicial bias. The second improvement on the existing literature on judicial bias involves focusing on outcome disparities in the civil (rather than criminal) justice system. Although numerous studies explore gender-based disparities in the criminal justice sphere, only a very small number of studies explore such disparities in the civil arena. We found clear disparities in the allocation of litigation costs between men and women. Male plaintiffs who lost were ordered to pay the winners' legal fees more often than were losing women as sole plaintiffs or as part of all-women plaintiff groups. Likewise, the fees women plaintiffs who lost a case were obliged to pay were less than those required of losing men, and women defendants who won cases received higher fee awards than similarly situated men.",08 August 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 3", 536-561,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12124

195,"Insurance Crisis or Liability Crisis? Medical Malpractice Claiming in Illinois, 1980–2010","Mohammad Rahmati, David A. Hyman, Bernard Black, Charles Silver","Since 1980, Illinois has experienced three medical malpractice insurance crises—in the mid-1980s, mid-1990s, and early-2000s. Each time, Illinois responded by enacting tort reform. Using a previously unavailable database of closed medical malpractice (med mal) claims, maintained by the Illinois Department of Insurance, we analyze statewide trends in med mal claiming from 1980–2010, covering all three crises. Paid claim rates rose sharply from 1980–1985, roughly leveled off from 1986–1993, and then began a sustained decline. By 2010, paid claims rates were 75 percent lower than in the peak year (1991). Payout per claim has steadily increased since 1980, but these increases can be entirely explained by the virtual disappearance of smaller paid claims and claims involving less severe injuries. The total direct cost of med mal litigation (payouts and defense costs) rose sharply from 1980–1992, with a jump in 1991, and then declined steadily, with a more modest jump during 2000–2002, which persisted through 2006. Thus, of the three Illinois insurance crises, only the first coincided in time with a major change in claiming. Rather than becoming more generous over time, the Illinois med mal system has squeezed out claimants with less severe injuries and smaller claims.",11 May 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 2", 183-204,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12113
196,What Predicts Law Student Success? A Longitudinal Study Correlating Law Student Applicant Data and Law School Outcomes,"Alexia Brunet Marks, Scott A. Moss","Despite the rise of “big data” empiricism, law school admission remains heavily impressionistic; admission decisions rely on anecdotes about recent students, idiosyncratic preferences for certain majors or jobs, or mainly the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). Yet no predictors are well-validated and studies of the LSAT or other factors fail to control for other factors. The lack of evidence for what actually predicts law school success is especially surprising since, after the 2010s downturn, law schools now compete for fewer applicants. We fill this gap with a two-school, 1,400-student, 2005–2011 longitudinal study. We coded nondigitized applicant data and used multivariate regression analysis to predict law school grades (LGPA) from many variables: LSAT; college grades (UGPA), quality, and major; UGPA trajectory; employment duration and type (legal, scientific, military, teaching, etc.); college leadership; prior graduate degree; criminal or disciplinary record; and variable interactions (e.g., high-LSAT/low-UGPA or vice-versa). Our results include new findings about how to balance LSAT and UGPA, plus the first findings that college quality, major, work experience, and other traits are significant predictors of law student grades, controlling for other factors: (1) LSAT predicts more weakly, and UGPA more powerfully, than commonly assumed—and a high-LSAT/low-UGPA profile may predict worse than the opposite; (2) a STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) or EAF (economics, accounting, finance) major is a significant plus, akin to three and a half to four extra LSAT points; (3) several years’ work experience is a significant plus, with teaching especially positive and military the weakest; (4) a criminal or disciplinary record is a significant minus, akin to seven and a half fewer LSAT points; and (5) long-noted gender disparities seem to have abated, but racial disparities persist. Some predictors were interestingly nonlinear: college quality has decreasing returns; UGPA has increasing returns; a rising UGPA is a plus only for law students right out of college; and four to nine years of work is a “sweet spot.” Certain groups—those with military or public-sector work, or a criminal/disciplinary record—have high LGPA variance, indicating a mix of high and low performers requiring close scrutiny. Many traditionally valued traits had no predictive value: typical prelaw majors (political science, history, etc.); legal or public-sector work; or college leadership. These findings can help identify who can outperform traditional predictors like the LSAT. Several caveats are explained in the article, however, because statistical models cannot capture certain difficult-to-code key traits: some who project to have weak grades retain appealing lawyering or leadership potential; and many will over- or underperform any projection. Thus, admissions will always be both art and science—but perhaps with a bit more science.",11 May 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 2", 205-265,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12114
197,Carrot or Stick? The Shift from Voluntary to Mandatory Disclosure of Risk Factors,"Karen K. Nelson, A. C. Pritchard","This study investigates risk factor disclosures, examining both the voluntary, incentive-based disclosure regime provided by the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act as well as the SEC's subsequent mandate of these disclosures. Firms subject to greater litigation risk disclose more risk factors, update the language more from year to year, and use more readable language than firms with lower litigation risk. These differences in the quality of disclosure are pronounced in the voluntary disclosure regime, but converge following the SEC mandate as low-risk firms improved the quality of their risk factor disclosures. Consistent with these findings, the risk factor disclosures of high-litigation-risk firms are significantly more informative about systematic and idiosyncratic firm risk when disclosure is voluntary but not when disclosure is mandatory. Overall, the results suggest that for some firms voluntary disclosure of risk factors is not a substitute for a regulatory mandate.",11 May 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 2", 266-297,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12115

This effect is documented in numerous legal settings (e.g., torts, corporate, copyright) and across both expert (i.e., experienced lawyers) and nonexpert (i.e., students) populations. Furthermore, the effect is shown to exist both when participants express judgments on a numeric scale and when they make dichotomous judgments that are detached from that scale.

We use the data of 467 firm groups that participated in 88 cartels convicted by the European Commission between 2000 and 2012 to study both the characteristics of firm groups filing an appeal and the factors that determine their successfulness in terms of fine reduction. Applying a discrete choice and a two-stage hurdle model, we find that while some characteristics—particularly the reform of the fine guidelines—only affect the probability of filing an appeal, other factors, such as the size of the fine imposed, in connection with characteristics such as ringleader, repeat offender, or leniency applicant, influence both the probability and the success of an appeal. We build on these results to derive conclusions for both firms and public policymakers.",11 May 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 2", 330-357,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12117
200,Testing the Expressive Theory of Punishment,Kenworthey Bilz,"This article presents empirical support for the argument that punishment of a wrongdoer affects the social standing of the victim. This argument is most closely associated with the expressive theory of punishment, especially as articulated by the moral philosopher Jean Hampton (Murphy & Hampton 1988; Hampton 1992). In three experiments I show support for the basic point of Hampton's expressive theory, that punishing a criminal offender does increase the victim's social standing in the community, and failing to punish diminishes it. I show this effect across three very different types of crime: rape, credit theft, and battery. I also test some logical extensions of Hampton's expressive theory of punishment. For instance, if victims gain or lose social standing as a result of punishing, so—inversely—should offenders. In addition, different punishers should affect different sources of social standing (such as ingroup vs. outgroup standing). Finally, the effects on perceived social standing should be felt not just by victims, but by third-party observers as well. I find support for these subsidiary predictions.",11 May 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 2", 358-392,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12118
201,Judicial Retirements and the Staying Power of U.S. Supreme Court Decisions,"Stuart Minor Benjamin, Georg Vanberg","The influence of U.S. Supreme Court majority opinions depends critically on how these opinions are received and treated by lower courts, which decide the vast majority of legal disputes. We argue that the retirement of justices on the Supreme Court serves as a simple heuristic device for lower court judges in deciding how much deference to show to Supreme Court precedent. Using a unique data set of the treatment of all Supreme Court majority opinions in the courts of appeals from 1953 to 2012, we find that negative treatments of Supreme Court opinions increase, and positive treatments decrease, as the justices who supported a decision retire from the Court. Importantly, this effect exists over and above the impact of retirements on the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court.",08 February 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 1", 5-26,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12095
202,SEC Investigations and Securities Class Actions: An Empirical Comparison,"Stephen J. Choi, A. C. Pritchard","Using actions with both an SEC investigation and a class action as our baseline, we compare the targeting of SEC-only investigations with class-action-only lawsuits. Looking at measures of information asymmetry, we find that investors in the market perceive greater information asymmetry following the public announcement of the underlying violation for class-action-only lawsuits compared with SEC-only investigations. Turning to sanctions, we find that the incidence of top officer resignation is greater for class-action-only lawsuits relative to SEC-only investigations. Our findings are consistent with the private enforcement targeting disclosure violations at least as precisely as (if not more so than) SEC enforcement.",08 February 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 1", 27-49,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12096
203,Apples and Oranges: An International Comparison of the Public's Experience of Justiciable Problems and the Methodological Issues Affecting Comparative Study,"P. Pleasence, N. J. Balmer, R. L. Sandefur","Since the mid-1990s, at least 28 large-scale national surveys of the public's experience of justiciable problems have been conducted in at least 15 separate jurisdictions, reflecting widespread legal aid reform activity. While the majority of these surveys take their structure from Genn's Paths to Justice survey (1999), they vary significantly in length, scope, mode of administration, types of problems included, survey reference period, data structure, data analysis, and question formulation. This article draws on surveys from across the world, contrasting their methodologies, comparing their headline findings, and setting out the potential for bias as a consequence of methodological variation. The article also presents findings from five online experiments testing the impact of various question formulations on problem prevalence, use of advice, and formal processes. Specifically, the experiments test whether varying the reference period, describing problems as “legal,” offering detailed as opposed to simple problem descriptions, and describing problems as “difficult to solve” had an impact on reported prevalence of justiciable problems, and whether presenting lists as opposed to a series of individual questions had an impact on reported use of advice and processes. The experiments demonstrated that modest differences in question formulation yield significantly different results. Specifically, alteration of survey reference period did not result in a proportional change in reported problem prevalence, introducing problems as either “legal” or “difficult to solve” significantly reduced reported prevalence, and introducing use of advice/processes as multiple questions rather than as lists significantly increased reported use. The risks involved in comparative analysis (and particularly in looking beyond methodology when attempting to explain jurisdictional variation) are discussed. In relation to future studies, the importance of understanding the impact of methodological change, learning the lessons of the past, making technical details transparent, and making data available are highlighted.",08 February 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 1", 50-93,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12097
204,Forecasting Domestic Violence: A Machine Learning Approach to Help Inform Arraignment Decisions,"Richard A. Berk, Susan B. Sorenson, Geoffrey Barnes","Arguably the most important decision at an arraignment is whether to release an offender until the date of his or her next scheduled court appearance. Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, threats to public safety can be a key factor in that decision. Implicitly, a forecast of “future dangerousness” is required. In this article, we consider in particular whether usefully accurate forecasts of domestic violence can be obtained. We apply machine learning to data on over 28,000 arraignment cases from a major metropolitan area in which an offender faces domestic violence charges. One of three possible post-arraignment outcomes is forecasted within two years: (1) a domestic violence arrest associated with a physical injury, (2) a domestic violence arrest not associated with a physical injury, and (3) no arrests for domestic violence. We incorporate asymmetric costs for different kinds of forecasting errors so that very strong statistical evidence is required before an offender is forecasted to be a good risk. When an out-of-sample forecast of no post-arraignment domestic violence arrests within two years is made, it is correct about 90 percent of the time. Under current practice within the jurisdiction studied, approximately 20 percent of those released after an arraignment for domestic violence are arrested within two years for a new domestic violence offense. If magistrates used the methods we have developed and released only offenders forecasted not to be arrested for domestic violence within two years after an arraignment, as few as 10 percent might be arrested. The failure rate could be cut nearly in half. Over a typical 24-month period in the jurisdiction studied, well over 2,000 post-arraignment arrests for domestic violence perhaps could be averted.",08 February 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 1", 94-115,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12098
205,Unpacking Negligence Liability: Experimentally Testing the Governance Effect,"Theodore Eisenberg, Christoph Engel","Arguably, if a court holds a defendant liable for negligently inflicting harm on the plaintiff, this intervention combines three effects: (1) the court specifies the normative expectation, (2) the court expresses dissatisfaction with the plaintiff's behavior, for example, her level of activity, and (3) the court obliges the defendant to compensate the plaintiff. In the field, it would be close to impossible to disentangle the three effects, or to investigate how they interact with intrinsic reticence to inflict harm on a passive outsider. We therefore go to the lab. We do not find an effect of intrinsic morality. However, the intervention has a separate significant effect on each of the three channels.",08 February 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 1", 116-152,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12099
206,Does the Chief Justice Make Partisan Appointments to Special Courts and Panels?,Maxwell Palmer,"The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has the exclusive and independent power to appoint federal judges to various special courts and panels, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), the court that oversees all domestic surveillance for national security, including domestic data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA). This article examines the propensity of Chief Justices to appoint co-partisan judges to these panels. Such appointments may serve to produce decisions and policies that align with the Chief Justice's preferences. I use computational simulations to model the appointment decisions made by Chief Justices. I find that there is less than a 1 percent chance that a neutral Chief Justice would appoint as many Republicans to the FISC as have been appointed in the last 36 years. I further show that the Chief Justice is not selecting appointees on other observable judicial characteristics, such as age, experience, gender, senior status, or caseload. These results have important implications for the creation of judicial institutions, the internal politics of the judiciary, legislative delegation, and the powers and oversight of the national security state.",08 February 2016,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 13, Issue 1", 153-177,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12100

210,The Consequences of Being an Object of Suspicion: Potential Pitfalls of Proactive Police Contact,"Tom R. Tyler, Jonathan Jackson, Avital Mentovich","During the latter half of the 20th century U.S. policing became more professional (Skogan & Frydl 2004) and the rate of violent crime declined dramatically (Blumstein & Wallman 2000). Yet public trust and confidence in the police increased at best marginally and there has been a large and continuing racial gap in police legitimacy. This article reviews changes in police policy and practice to explore the reasons for this seeming paradox. It is argued that a new model of proactive police stops has increased both the frequency and the range of police contact with people in the community. Such police contact does not inherently undermine public trust in the police, but the style of such contact, which involves the police communicating suspicion of ongoing or future criminal conduct and seeking to prevent it via the threat or use of coercion, has not increased trust. This article examines how such policies developed and why they are problematic. The result of a survey of Americans shows that perceived suspicion damages the social bonds between the police and the community and undermines trust in the police. The article concludes by arguing that police contact need not be inherently negative and contact during which the police use fair procedures can addresses issues of crime and disorder while building trust and confidence.",27 October 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 4", 602-636,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12086
211,Leases and Executory Contracts in Chapter 11,Kenneth Ayotte,"This article offers the first empirical analysis of the timing and disposition decisions large Chapter 11 debtors make with respect to their leases and other bilateral (“executory”) contracts in bankruptcy, with an emphasis on commercial real estate leases. Section 365, which governs these contracts, allows debtors to choose whether to keep (“assume”), abandon (“reject”), or transfer (“assign”) their contracts, with time limits provided by the Bankruptcy Code. The main goal of the article is to analyze a controversial change to the Code in 2005 (BAPCPA) that shortens the time to expiration of a debtor's option to reject, requiring tenant-debtors to make decisions on their real estate leases within seven months unless a landlord grants an extension. I find that the seven-month limit strongly accelerated real estate lease disposition decisions, suggesting that bankruptcy bargaining is far from a frictionless, Coasean world. Further, I find that BAPCPA is associated with a significantly lower probability of reorganization for the most lease-intensive firms. I also test a simple theory of real options, and I find that debtors do not behave as the simple theory suggests. In particular, many executory contracts are assumed before expiration. I present suggestive evidence of implicit contracting motives: debtors often assume early in order to secure performance from their counterparties that cannot be guaranteed by the contract alone.",27 October 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 4", 637-663,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12087
212,Interparty Judicial Appointments,Jonathan Remy Nash,"Empirical studies of judges’ ideological voting call for a theory according to which the ideology of the judges can be measured. This article calls into question the assumption that undergirds the measure that currently dominates the legal, economic, and political science literature—the assumption that the ideology of a lower federal court judge is largely predicted by the ideologies of the nominating president and the relevant state's senators who are of the same political party as the president. The article relies on a natural experiment to examine this question empirically. Between 1977 and 1998, New York was represented in the Senate by one Democrat and one Republican who had an agreement to divide appointments to the district courts in the state: the senator who shared party affiliation with the president would be allocated three of every four appointments, while the “out-of-party” senator would be allocated the rest. The article employs a novel data set—consisting of all federal district judges appointed to the federal bench in New York during the time period in question, and the senator who recommended each nominee to the nominating president. If the dominant theory—that the party of the recommending senator affects judicial decision making—holds, then one would expect the theory's explanatory power to be at its apex where senators of different parties recommend judges at the same time to the same president. Yet, using median prison sentence length as a proxy for ideology in decision making, the empirical analysis finds no evidence that senatorial ideology has a statistically significant effect on district judge decision making. At the same time, it finds that, indeed, the nominating president's ideology does have a statistically significant effect. The findings are instead consistent with the minority view of lower federal court judges’ ideological leanings—that a lower federal court judge's ideology is in large part a function solely of the nominating president's ideology.",27 October 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 4", 664-685,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12088
213,Inside the Caucus: An Empirical Analysis of Mediation from Within,"Daniel Klerman, Lisa Klerman","This article provides a glimpse into the worlds of mediation and settlement negotiation. Because they are almost always private, there has been relatively little empirical analysis of the dynamics of settlement or mediation. This article analyzes a unique data set derived from a mediator's contemporaneous notes of mediations involving employment disputes, such as claims of discrimination or wrongful termination. Although the data set includes more than 400 cases, since they were all mediated by a single mediator, this article can be viewed as a case study. Among the most interesting facts uncovered by this analysis are the following. Mediation can be extremely effective in facilitating settlement. The mediator studied here achieved a settlement rate of over 94 percent. There are very few gender differences, whether one looks at the gender of the plaintiff or the gender of the lawyers. For example, settlement rates are the same for male and female plaintiffs and lawyers. On average, cases settle much closer to the defendant's first offer than the plaintiff's, irrespective of case type, size of law firm, or other factors. A mediator's proposal appears to be the most effective mediation technique. A mediator's proposal was used in almost 90 percent of cases and, when it was used, the settlement rate was over 99 percent.",27 October 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 4", 686-715,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12089
214,Does Juvenile Delinquency Reduce Educational Attainment?,"Shannon Ward, Jenny Williams","This article investigates the effect of delinquency in youth on subsequent educational attainment. To do so, we focus on delinquent acts committed by age 16 and examine their impact on two measures of educational attainment: high school graduation and college graduation. Using information on males from the extremely rich National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, we find plausible evidence that delinquency by age 16 reduces the likelihood of graduating from high school and college. This effect is driven by early initiators, those who offend intensely, and by those whose delinquent activities involve income-generating acts. Importantly, the impact of delinquency on education is not confined to those who have interaction with the criminal justice system, or gang members. Further analysis suggests that a channel through which delinquency impacts education is expected returns to crime, as reflected by subjective beliefs about the probability of arrest for a property crime.",27 October 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 4", 716-756,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12090
215,Can a Single Country Increase the Taxes of Multinational Corporations? Evidence from the Impact of the 1993 Corporate Tax Rate Increase on Fortune 500 Companies,"Nathan M. Jensen, Adam H. Rosenzweig","There is a debate in the literature about the ability of multinational corporations to use legal mechanisms, such as transfer pricing and intercompany debt, to prevent any one country from meaningfully increasing effective tax rates (ETRs) on corporations. Evidence suggests that tremendous shifting of profits across borders is occurring, leading to calls for significant policy responses. At the same time, multinational companies are also observed relocating their headquarters or reincorporating in foreign jurisdictions, at least in part for tax reasons. This has led many to claim that international tax in a globalized world has devolved into a race to the bottom. In response, multinational organizations such as the OECD and G-20 have called for increased multilateralism and cooperation as the last, best hope for the international tax regime. Yet, to date little has been written on the extent to which any one, single country can meaningfully increase taxes on multinational companies unilaterally through changes in rate. We contribute to this literature by designing an empirical study of whether and to what extent a largely unanticipated tax rate increase in a single country affects the ultimate tax liability of multinational corporations. We do so by examining how an actual increase in corporate tax rates in the United States impacted worldwide cash taxes for Fortune 500 companies. Using the 1 percent corporate tax rate increase enacted in 1993, which was enacted for one year without any accompanying base changes, we find that this rate increase led to an increase in worldwide cash taxes reported by multinational companies across the board. We include a number of case studies to further explore the implications of this tax increase. These case studies support the contention that little tax avoidance occurred immediately in response to the increase in the tax rate.",27 October 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 4", 757-780,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12091

By analyzing a unique set of time-series data and archives, this article investigates a variety of legal measures (the death penalty, formal judicial guidance, and the revision and upgrade of substantive rules) implemented by the Chinese government in response to a critical threat–pipeline vandalization. The findings of this study cast doubt on the alleged deterrent effect of capital punishment. Moreover, it finds the supreme judicial bodies in China to be ready servants of the state's core interests, yet their service adds marginal value as legal dynamics at the local level are shaped mainly by the power distribution of relevant parties. Furthermore, the statutory upgrade does not benefit, and may even harm, pipeline safety. As the upgrade codified the status quo of the bargaining between the oil SOEs and the local governments, the statutory allocation of primary protective responsibilities to the former might have relieved the latter from active participation in pipeline protection that is essential to preventing oil thefts. Findings from this research contribute to the literatures on Chinese law and politics, capital punishment, and the rule by law in authoritarian regimes.",27 October 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 4", 815-846,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12093

Farid, Jay Bhattacharya","Reforms introduced by the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act (ACA) build new sources of coverage around employment-based health insurance. But what if firms find it cheaper to have their employees obtain insurance from these sources, even after accounting for penalties (for nonprovision of insurance) and employee bonuses (to ensure the shift is cost neutral for employees)? State and local governments (SLGs) have strong incentives to consider the economics of such “divestment”; many have particularly large unfunded benefits liabilities. We investigated whether SLGs would save under two scenarios: (1) shifting all employees and under-65 retirees to alternative sources of coverage and (2) shifting only employees whose household incomes indicate they would be eligible for federally-subsidized coverage and all under-65 retirees. Full divestment would cost SLGs more than they currently pay, due primarily to penalty costs. Selective divestment could save SLGs nearly $129 billion over 10 years at the expense of the federal government.",20 August 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 3", 343-394,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12076

The analysis uses sentencing data collected by the Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC). Among first-time offenders, both the race-only models and race and skin color models estimate that, on average, blacks receive sentences that are 4.25 percent higher than those of whites even after controlling for legally-relevant factors such as the type of crime. However, the skin color model also shows us that this figure hides important intraracial differences in sentence length: while medium- and dark-skinned blacks receive sentences that are about 4.8 percent higher than those of whites, lighter-skinned blacks receive sentences that are not statistically significantly different from those of whites. After controlling for socioeconomic status in the race-only and race and skin color models the remaining difference between whites and dark- and medium-skinned blacks increases slightly, to 5.5 percent.

221,Who Responds to U.S. News & World Report's Law School Rankings?,"Jeffrey Evans Stake, Michael Alexeev","U.S. News & World Report (USN&WR) publishes annual rankings of ABA-approved law schools. The popularity of these rankings raises the question of whether they influence the behavior of law teachers, lawyers and judges, law school applicants, employers, or law school administrators. This study explores some indicia of USN&WR influence. Using data purchased from USN&WR, we attempt to determine whether USN&WR might have influenced (1) law faculty members who respond to the USN&WR survey of law school quality, (2) lawyers who respond to USN&WR surveys, (3) law school applicants choosing a school, (4) employers who hire law school graduates, and (5) administrators who set tuition. We find significant effects on the first three groups, particularly with respect to lower-rank schools. That is, there may be “echo effects” of USN&WR rankings that are folded back into subsequent rankings and tend to stabilize them. We also find that rankings may exert some influence on tuition at law schools outside the top 40. We do not find evidence that employers hiring law graduates respond to changes in USN&WR rankings, either in median salaries paid or in employment percentages reported by law schools.",20 August 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 3", 421-480,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12078
222,Do Economic Downturns Dampen Patent Litigation?,"Alan Marco, Shawn Miller,, Ted Sichelman","Recent studies estimate that the economic impact of U.S. patent litigation may be as large as $80 billion per year and that the overall rate of U.S. patent litigation has been growing rapidly over the past 20 years. And yet, the relationship of the macroeconomy to patent litigation rates has never been studied in any rigorous fashion. This lacuna is notable given that there are two opposing theories among lawyers regarding the effect of economic downturns on patent litigation. One camp argues for a substitution theory, holding that patent litigation should increase in a downturn because potential plaintiffs have a greater incentive to exploit patent assets relative to other investments. The other camp posits a capital constraint theory that holds that the decrease in cash flow and available capital disincentivizes litigation. Analyzing quarterly patent infringement suit filing data from 1971–2009 using a time-series vector autoregression (VAR) model, we show that economic downturns have significantly affected patent litigation rates. (To aid other researchers in testing and extending our analyses, we have made our entire data set available online.) Importantly, we find that these effects have changed over time. In particular, patent litigation has become more dependent on credit availability in a downturn. We hypothesize that such changes resulted from an increase in use of contingent-fee attorneys by patent plaintiffs and the rise of nonpracticing entities (NPEs), which, unlike most operating companies, generally fund their lawsuits directly from outside capital sources. Over roughly the last 20 years, we find that macroeconomic conditions have affected patent litigation in contrasting ways. Decreases in GDP (particularly economy-wide investment) are correlated with significant increases in patent litigation and countercyclical economic trends. On the other hand, increases in T-bill and real interest rates as well as increases in economy-wide financial risk are generally correlated with significant decreases in patent suits, leading to procyclical trends. Thus, the specific nature of a downturn predicts whether patent litigation rates will tend to rise or fall.",20 August 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 3", 481-536,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12079

It seems that antitrust neglects the fact that for more than 50 years, economists have been doing experiments on this very question. Almost any conceivable determinant of higher or lower collusion has been tested.

224,“Too Many Notes”?† An Empirical Study of Advocacy in Federal Appeals,"Gregory C. Sisk, Michael Heise","The warp and woof of U.S. law are threaded by the appellate courts, generating precedents on constitutional provisions, statutory texts, and common-law doctrines. Although the product of the appellate courts is regularly the subject of empirical study, less attention has been given to the sources and methods of appellate advocacy. Given the paramount place of written briefs in the appellate process, we should examine seriously the frequent complaint by appellate judges that briefs are too long and that prolixity weakens persuasive power. In a study of civil appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, we discover that, for appellants, briefs of greater length are strongly correlated with success on appeal. For the party challenging an adverse decision below, persuasive completeness may be more important than condensed succinctness. The underlying cause of both greater appellant success and accompanying longer briefs may lie in the typically complex nature of the reversible civil appeal. In light of our findings, the current proposal to reduce the limits on number of words in federal appellate briefs may cut more sharply against appellants. Experienced appellate advocates submit that familiarity with appellate courts, the honed ability to craft the right arguments with the appropriate style in briefing, and expertise in navigating the appellate system provide superior legal representation to clients. Our study lends support to this claim. We found a positive correlation between success and experience for lawyers representing appellees, thus warranting further study of lawyer specialization.",20 August 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 3", 578-600,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12081
225,Sentence Reductions for a Guilty Plea in England and Wales: Exploring New Empirical Trends,"Julian V. Roberts, Ben Bradford","Although most jurisdictions award sentence discounts to defendants who plead guilty, the exact magnitude of reductions awarded, and the factors determining the levels of reduction, remain underresearched. In addition, the limited research conducted to date in England and Wales has drawn on data sources that prevent the researcher from excluding the effect of factors correlated with the plea. This article reports original findings from a new sentencing database that draws its data directly from the sentencing judge. This jurisdiction is interesting also because courts must follow a sentencing guideline that contains specific recommendations regarding the appropriate discount. Analyses reveal that the plea-based discounts are more modest than reported by previous researchers. In addition, the data reveal a significant degree of judicial compliance with the guideline, although some departures from the guideline are identified and discussed.",28 April 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 2", 187-210,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12069
226,Multidistrict Centralization: An Empirical Examination,"Emery G. Lee III, Catherine R. Borden, Margaret S. Williams, Kevin M. Scott","Following the judiciary's experience with aggregate litigation in the 1960s, Congress established a procedure for the transfer of related cases to a single district court for coordinated pretrial proceedings. Originally designed to achieve efficiencies associated with coordinated discovery, the multidistrict litigation (MDL) process evolved from a rather modest starting point to become a central part of aggregate litigation in the federal courts today. Despite its importance, however, there is little empirical research on the MDL process. This article seeks to fill this gap in the empirical literature by addressing a few central questions about the work of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (Panel). Using a unique database, we examine how that body decided motions to centralize multidistrict litigation. We find, most importantly, that the Panel became more likely to order centralization of proceedings over time, after controlling for other factors. That trend is not, however, apparent in the most recent years' data. We also find, all else equal, that the Panel is more likely to centralize a proceeding including class allegations, and more likely to centralize proceedings raising certain kinds of claims.",28 April 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 2", 211-235,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12070
227,Disclosures About Disclosures: Can Conflict of Interest Warnings be Made More Effective?,"Ahmed E. Taha, John V. Petrocelli","People regularly rely on advisors who have conflicts of interest. The law often requires advisors to disclose these conflicts. Despite these disclosures, people generally insufficiently discount conflicted advice. This might be partly due to people interpreting the very fact that the advisor is disclosing a conflict of interest as a sign that the advisor is trustworthy, undermining the purpose and effectiveness of the disclosure. This article presents the results of an experiment indicating that requiring advisors to also disclose that they are legally required to disclose their conflict of interest makes people discount their advice more. This occurs, at least in part, because such advisors are viewed as less trustworthy than advisors who merely disclose their conflict of interest without also stating that the disclosure is legally required.",28 April 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 2", 236-251,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12071
228,On Probation: An Experimental Analysis,"Christoph Engel, Heike Hennig-Schmidt, Bernd Irlenbusch, Sebastian Kube","Does probation pay a double dividend? Society saves the cost of incarceration, and convicts preserve their liberty. But does probation also reduce the risk of recidivism? In a meta-study we show that the field evidence is inconclusive. Moreover, it struggles with an identification problem: those put on probation are less likely to recidivate in the first place. We therefore complement the existing field evidence with a novel lab experiment that isolates the definitional feature of probation: the first sanction is conditional on being sanctioned again during the probation period. We find that probationers are more likely to recidivate (i.e., to reduce their contributions to a joint project), that punishment cost is higher, efficiency lower, and inequity higher. While experimental subjects are on probation, they increase their contributions to a joint project. However, once the probation period expires, they reduce their contributions. While in the aggregate these two effects almost cancel out, critically, those not punished themselves trust the institution less if punishment does not become immediately effective.",28 April 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 2", 252-288,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12072
229,Social Networks and Personal Bankruptcy,Michelle M. Miller,"This article examines the role of social networks in a household's bankruptcy decision. Social networks may affect a household's bankruptcy decision in many ways: they could provide information about the required paperwork, recommend an attorney, reduce the stigma associated with bankruptcy, or increase awareness of its benefits. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), I exploit county and racial variation to identify network effects. My empirical strategy asks whether being surrounded by others of the same race increases bankruptcy use more for those in racial groups with high filing rates. This methodology allows me to include both county-year and racial-group fixed effects in my regressions. The results strongly confirm the importance of networks in a household's bankruptcy decision.",28 April 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 2", 289-310,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12073
230,Does Delegation Undermine Accountability? Experimental Evidence on the Relationship Between Blame Shifting and Control,Adam Hill,"A small but growing literature in experimental economics finds that principals can shift responsibility for blameworthy behavior to agents, even when those agents are effectively powerless. Prior work in this field measures blameworthy behavior only indirectly, however. It uses modified dictator games to measure attributions of blame for inequitable allocations of wealth. Yet participants might find inequitable allocations of wealth not blameworthy. Thus, such indirect measures leave open the possibility that prior work is not measuring blame shifting at all. This article corrects for a crucial shortcoming by providing a direct measure of blame-shifting behavior. It reports and discusses first-of-its-kind experimental evidence that shows that principals can delegate to powerless intermediaries in order to evade blame.",28 April 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 2", 311-339,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12074

235,Damages Versus Specific Performance: Lessons from Commercial Contracts,"Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey P. Miller","Specific performance is a central contractual remedy but, in Anglo-American law, generally is subordinate to damages. Despite rich theoretical discussions of specific performance, little is known about parties' treatment of the remedy in their contracts. We study 2,347 contracts of public corporations to quantify the presence or absence of specific performance clauses in several types of contracts. Although a majority of contracts do not refer to specific performance, substantial variation exists in the rates of including specific performance clauses. High rates of specific performance use in the area of corporate combinations through merger (53.4 percent) or assets sales (45.1 percent), inclusion of specific performance in some contracts of every type, and much lower use of it in loan agreements suggest that treatment of specific performance in sophisticated corporate contracts is more complex than existing theories of contractual remedies allow. Theories should expressly account for contract type variation. We also present results on the associations among contractual acceptance of five default dispute resolution rules: specific performance clauses, arbitration clauses, jury trial waiver clauses, litigation forum clauses, and attorney fee clauses. Rejecting the default damages rule in favor of specific performance is associated with rejecting each of the four other dispute resolution clauses.",18 February 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 1", 29-69,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12064
236,The Death Penalty: Should the Judge or the Jury Decide Who Dies?,"Valerie P. Hans, John H. Blume, Theodore Eisenberg, Amelia Courtney Hritz, Sheri Lynn Johnson, Caisa Elizabeth Royer, Martin T. Wells","This article addresses the effect of judge versus jury decision making through analysis of a database of all capital sentencing phase hearing trials in the State of Delaware from 1977–2007. Over the three decades of the study, Delaware shifted responsibility for death penalty sentencing from the jury to the judge. Currently, Delaware is one of the handful of states that gives the judge the final decision-making authority in capital trials. Controlling for a number of legally relevant and other predictor variables, we find that the shift to judge sentencing significantly increased the number of death sentences. Statutory aggravating factors, stranger homicides, and the victim's gender also increased the likelihood of a death sentence, as did the county of the homicide. We reflect on the implications of these results for debates about the constitutionality of judge sentencing in capital cases.",18 February 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 1", 70-99,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12065
237,Plaintiphobia in State Courts Redux? An Empirical Study of State Court Trials on Appeal,"Theodore Eisenberg, Michael Heise","Prior federal and state civil appeals studies show that appeals courts overturn jury verdicts more than bench decisions and that defendants fare better than plaintiffs on appeal. Attitudinal and selection effect hypotheses may help explain an appellate court tilt that favors defendants. This study builds on and extends our prior work on state civil appeals and examines a comprehensive state court civil appeals data set to test leading theories on appellate outcomes as well as to explore the relation between plaintiff success at trial and on appeal. Using data from 40 different states and 141 counties on 8,872 completed civil trials and 646 concluded appeals, we find that appellate reversal rates for jury trials and defendant appeals exceed reversal rates for bench trials and plaintiff appeals. The reversal rate for plaintiff appeals is 21 percent, compared with 40.9 percent for defendant appeals. The reversal rate for jury trials is 33.1 percent, compared with 25 percent for bench trials. Both the attitudinal and selection effect hypotheses find some level of support in our descriptive analyses and results from more formal models. Finally, we find little correlation between how plaintiffs fare at trial and how they fare on appeal.",18 February 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 1", 100-127,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12066
238,Pain and Suffering Damages in Wrongful Death Cases: An Empirical Study,"Yun-chien Chang, Theodore Eisenberg, Han-Wei Ho, Martin T. Wells","Most jurisdictions in the United States award pain and suffering damages to spouses of victims in wrongful death cases. In several East Asian countries, spouses, parents, and children of the victim can all demand pain and suffering damages. Despite the prevalence of this type of damages, and the oft-enormous amount of compensation, there has been no large-scale empirical study on how judges achieve the difficult task of assessing pain and suffering damages. Using a unique data set containing hundreds of car accident cases rendered by the court of first instance in Taiwan, with single-equation and structural-equation models, we find the plaintiffs' ad damnum has a statistically significant influence on the court-adjudicated pain and suffering damages. That could be evidence for the anchoring effect. Nevertheless, courts are very sensitive to the possibility of pushing defendants into financial hardship. When defendants' out-of-pocket payments of pecuniary damages, divided by defendants' income, are positive, this amount has a negative effect on the amount of pain and suffering damages, whereas when they are negative (this could happen because the amount of compulsory insurance payment had to be deducted), the amount in absolute value has a positive effect. Not all next-of-kin received the same amount. Spouses of the victim received more than other next-of-kin, and adult children received the least among eligible relatives. Parents, however, tended to be awarded a high amount of pain and suffering damages when they were the only familial group suing the defendant.",18 February 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 1", 128-160,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12067
239,"Addressing the Zeros Problem: Regression Models for Outcomes with a Large Proportion of Zeros, with an Application to Trial Outcomes","Theodore Eisenberg, Thomas Eisenberg, Martin T. Wells, Min Zhang","In law-related and other social science contexts, researchers need to account for data with an excess number of zeros. In addition, dollar damages in legal cases also often are skewed. This article reviews various strategies for dealing with this data type. Tobit models are often applied to deal with the excess number of zeros, but these are more appropriate in cases of true censoring (e.g., when all negative values are recorded as zeros) and less appropriate when zeros are in fact often observed as the amount awarded. Heckman selection models are another methodology that is applied in this setting, yet they were developed for potential outcomes rather than actual ones. Two-part models account for actual outcomes and avoid the collinearity problems that often attend selection models. A two-part hierarchical model is developed here that accounts for both the skewed, zero-inflated nature of damages data and the fact that punitive damage awards may be correlated within case type, jurisdiction, or time. Inference is conducted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme. Tobit models, selection models, and two-part models are fit to two punitive damage awards data sets and the results are compared. We illustrate that the nonsignificance of coefficients in a selection model can be a consequence of collinearity, whereas that does not occur with two-part models.",18 February 2015,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 12, Issue 1", 161-186,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12068

We suggest that the PTO's reliance on prior grantees to subsidize current applicants exposes the PTO to a risk that its obligatory costs will surpass incoming fee collections. When such risks materialize, we hypothesize, and thereafter document, that the PTO will restore financial balance by extending preferential examination treatment—that is, higher granting propensities and/or shorter wait times—to some technologies over others.",28 October 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 4", 602-636,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12051

A regression analysis controlling for an array of legitimate factors relevant to the crime, defendant, and victim provides overwhelming evidence that minority defendants who kill white victims are capitally charged at substantially higher rates than minority defendants who kill minorities, that geography influences both capital charging and sentencing decisions (with the location of a crime in Waterbury being the single most potent influence on which death-eligible cases will lead to a sentence of death), and that the Connecticut death penalty system has not limited its application to the worst of the worst death-eligible defendants. The work of an expert hired by the State of Connecticut provided emphatic, independent confirmation of these three findings, and found that women who commit death-eligible crimes are less likely than men to be sentenced to death.",28 October 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 4", 637-696,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12052
242,Deliberative Democracy and the American Civil Jury,"Valerie P. Hans, John Gastil, Traci Feller","Civil jury service should be a potent form of deliberative democracy, creating greater civic engagement. However, a 2010 seven-state study of jury service and voting records found no overall boost in civic engagement following service on civil juries, whereas jurors who served on criminal cases did show increased civic engagement following their jury service. This article reports a project that augments the civil jury data set with information about jury decision rule, jury size, defendant identity, and case type and examines whether specific types of civil jury service influence postservice voting. Taking into account preservice voting records, jurors who serve on a civil jury that is required to reach unanimity or a civil jury of 12 are significantly more likely to vote after their service. Jurors who decide cases with organizational, as opposed to individual, defendants likewise show a boost in voting behavior, as do jurors deciding contract or nonautomotive torts cases compared to automotive torts. Limitations and implications of these findings for deliberative democracy theory and jury practice are discussed.",28 October 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 4", 697-717,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12053
243,"Trademarks, Triggers, and Online Search","Stefan Bechtold, Catherine Tucker","Internet search engines display advertisements along with search results, providing them with a major source of revenue. The display of ads is triggered by the use of keywords, which are found in the searches performed by search engine users. The fact that advertisers can buy a keyword that contains a trademark they do not own has caused controversy worldwide. To explore the actual effects of trademark and keyword advertising policies, we exploit a natural experiment in Europe. Following a decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, Google relaxed its AdWords policy in continental Europe in September 2010. After the policy change, Google allowed advertisers to select a third party's trademark as a keyword to trigger the display of ads, with only a limited complaint procedure for trademark owners. We use click-stream data from European Internet users to explore the effect this policy change had on browsing behavior. Based on a data set of 5.38 million website visits before and after the policy change, we find little average change. However, we present evidence that this lack of average effect stems from an aggregation of two opposing effects. While navigational searches are less likely to lead to the trademark owner's website, non-navigational searches are more likely to lead to the trademark owner's website after the policy change. The effect of changing keyword advertising policies varies with the purpose of the consumers using the trademark, and it is more pronounced for lesser-known trademarks. The article points to tradeoffs trademark policy is facing beyond consumer confusion. More generally, the article proposes a novel way of analyzing the effect of different allocations of property rights in intellectual property law.",28 October 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 4", 718-750,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12054
244,Street Stops and Police Legitimacy: Teachable Moments in Young Urban Men's Legal Socialization,"Tom R. Tyler, Jeffrey Fagan, Amanda Geller","An examination of the influence of street stops on the legal socialization of young men showed an association between the number of police stops they see or experience and a diminished sense of police legitimacy. This association was not primarily a consequence of the number of stops or of the degree of police intrusion during those stops. Rather, the impact of involuntary contact with the police was mediated by evaluations of the fairness of police actions and judgments about whether the police were acting lawfully. Whether the police were viewed as exercising their authority fairly and lawfully shaped the impact of stops on respondents' general judgments about police legitimacy. Fairness and lawfulness judgments, in turn, were influenced by the number of stops and the degree of police intrusion during those stops. Similarly, judgments of justice and lawfulness shaped the estimated influence of judgments of the general character of police behavior in the community on general perceptions of police legitimacy. These results suggest that the widespread use of street stops undermined legitimacy. Lowered legitimacy had an influence on both law abidingness and the willingness to cooperate with legal authorities. The findings show that people were influenced by perceptions of police injustice/illegality.",28 October 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 4", 751-785,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12055
245,Sex Offender Law and the Geography of Victimization,"Amanda Y. Agan, J.J. Prescott","Sex offender laws that target recidivism (e.g., community notification and residency restriction regimes) are premised—at least in part—on the idea that sex offender proximity and victimization risk are positively correlated. We examine this relationship by combining past and current address information of registered sex offenders (RSOs) with crime data from Baltimore County, Maryland, to study how crime rates vary across neighborhoods with different concentrations of resident RSOs. Contrary to the assumptions of policymakers and the public, we find that, all else equal, reported sex offense victimization risk is generally (although not uniformly) lower in neighborhoods where more RSOs live. To further probe the relationship between where RSOs live and where sex crime occurs, we consider whether public knowledge of the identity and proximity of RSOs may make offending in those areas more difficult for (or less attractive to) all potential sex offenders. We exploit the fact that Maryland's registry became searchable via the Internet during our sample period to investigate how laws that publicly identify RSOs may change the relationship between the residential concentration of RSOs and neighborhood victimization risk. Surprisingly, for some categories of sex crime, notification appears to increase the relative risk of victimization in neighborhoods with greater concentrations of RSOs.",28 October 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 4", 786-828,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12056

This article presents new data on how copyright stifles the reappearance of works. First, a random sample of more than 2,000 new books for sale on Amazon.com is analyzed along with a random sample of almost 2,000 songs available on new DVDs. Copyright status correlates highly with absence from the Amazon shelf. Together with publishing business models, copyright law seems to deter distribution and diminish access. Further analysis of eBook markets, used books on Abebooks.com, and the Chicago Public Library collection suggests that no alternative marketplace for out-of-print books has yet developed. Data from iTunes and YouTube, however, tell a different story for older hit songs.

To address this question I focus on one important legal institution—the use of plea bargaining in criminal cases. I develop a model in which the optimal scope of plea bargaining depends on social values. Specifically, a lower social emphasis on ensuring that innocent individuals are not punished, and a greater social emphasis on ensuring that guilty individuals are punished, lead to a greater use of plea bargaining. Using unique cross-country data on social preferences for punishing the innocent versus letting the guilty go free, as well as an original coding of plea bargaining regimes across countries, I obtain results that are consistent with the model.",28 October 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 4", 867-893,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12058
248,Choice of Law: An Empirical Analysis,Sarath Sanga,"I propose a new measure to study the law and economics of choice of law: “relative use of law.” Relative use of law measures the extent to which a state's laws are disproportionally over- or underutilized in contract. It is constructed by normalizing the distribution of choice of law clauses by the extent of contracting activity within each jurisdiction. Using this measure, I study choice of law by analyzing the nearly 1,000,000 contracts that have been disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission between 1996–2012. These are all contracts that companies registered with the SEC deemed “material.” I find that (1) only Delaware and New York are relatively overutilized and (2) firms' choice of law and relative use of law are converging toward Delaware, New York, and Nevada. I offer hypotheses for this convergence that are based on (1) lock-in effects of the choice of state of incorporation and (2) positive network effects of using the same law. I present suggestive evidence that lock-in effects explain convergence toward Delaware and Nevada, while network effects explain convergence toward New York.",28 October 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 4", 894-928,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12059

Davis","We examine factors that might explain how sanctions imposed in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement actions vary across the firms and countries implicated using a data set of FCPA actions resolved from 2004 to 2011. We find evidence that the sanctions in an individual FCPA action are positively correlated with the egregiousness and extensiveness of the bribe. The sanctions also increase if the ultimate parent company of entities involved in the FCPA violation is foreign and if foreign regulators are involved in the action. At the country level, we report evidence that the SEC and DOJ impose greater aggregate sanctions for violations in countries with a lower GNI per capita and weaker local anti-bribery institutions. The SEC and DOJ also impose disproportionately greater aggregate sanctions for violations where the home country of the ultimate parent company of FCPA defendants has a greater GNI per capita, stronger anti-bribery institutions, and a cooperation agreement with U.S. regulators. Overall, these findings suggest that factors besides those deemed relevant by U.S. and international law influence enforcement of the FCPA.",21 July 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 3", 409-445,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12045

Chen, Chun-Yuh Yang","The extent and existence of defensive medicine in the face of malpractice pressure are subjects of perennial policy and academic debate. In this article, we investigate the impact of a series of arguably exogenous court rulings in Taiwan that increased physicians' perceived liability exposure, and a subsequent amendment to the law that reversed the courts' rulings, on physicians' test-ordering behavior and choice of delivery method. We find that obstetricians most at risk for liability increased laboratory tests in response to the ruling, but did not change the likelihood of delivery by Cesarean sections. We further show no consistent patterns of preventable complications, postdelivery emergency department visits, or hospital readmissions associated with physician behavioral change. The overall pattern of results is highly suggestive of the practice of defensive medicine among physicians in Taiwan, and that payment incentives and provider organizational forms may have mediated the impact of changing liability risks.",21 July 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 3", 446-476,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12046
252,An Empirical Analysis of Cost Recovery in Superfund Cases: Implications for Brownfields and Joint and Several Liability,"Howard F.

We test these predictions empirically using data on outcomes in federal Superfund cases. Theory also suggests that this increase in the amount recovered may discourage the sale and redevelopment of potentially contaminated sites (or “brownfields”). We find the increase to be substantial, which suggests that this implicit tax on sales may be an important deterrent for parties contemplating brownfields redevelopment.",21 July 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 3", 477-504,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12047
253,Do Kinship Networks Strengthen Private Property? Evidence from Rural China,"Taisu Zhang, Xiaoxue Zhao","This article finds that the existence of strong kinship networks tends to limit state interference with private property use in rural China by protecting villagers against unwanted government land takings. It then distinguishes kinship networks from other kinds of social networks by showing that their deterrence effect against coercive takings is far more significant and resilient under conditions of prevalent rural-urban migration than deterrence by neighborhood cooperatives and religious groups. Finally, the article attempts to identify and differentiate between various possible mechanisms behind these effects: it argues that kinship networks protect private property usage mainly through encouraging social reciprocity between kinsmen, which facilitates collective action against coercive takings. Kinship networks are more effective than neighborhood cooperatives or religious groups at sustaining reciprocity over long distances and, therefore, are less affected by rural-urban migration. Altruism between kinsmen, however, does not emerge from the data as a major factor.",21 July 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 3", 505-540,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12048

Schultheis,"I propose an integrated method for evaluating the accessibility of civil legal aid services, one that is able to simultaneously account for spatial, social, and organizational accessibility determinants. Specifically, I use this study to empirically evaluate several core assumptions of accessibility research. First, I challenge the argument that gaps in the accessibility of civil legal aid services are driven by spatial mismatches and/or disconnects between supply and demand. Although these two factors are important, they only provide a partial explanation of the observed variation in the accessibility of civil legal aid services. Second, I challenge the commonplace assumption in accessibility research that the effects of accessibility determinants, including the spatial relationship between client and provider location, are consistent across social and geographic space. In addition to raising these issues, I also propose and develop a hierarchical linear model that attempts to bridge methodological approaches that limit our understanding of the interactions of the spatial, social, and organizational dimensions of civil legal aid services accessibility . Perhaps most importantly, the proposed accessibility model begins to offer providers novel insights into how to better allocate program resources to best serve their client population.",21 July 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 3", 541-577,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12049

Dhami","Settling a legal dispute out of court is typically a good result for both parties. However, many disputes do not settle: the presence of cognitive biases, such as those observed through framing manipulations, is thought to be one of the many reasons for settlement failure. The present study used quantitative and qualitative data to compare the impact of a gain- or loss-framed hypothetical civil litigation scenario on settlement decisions made by lawyers and other nonlawyer professionals. A significant effect of framing was found for both groups. As predicted, both nonlawyers and lawyers were much more likely to settle their claim in the gain scenario than in the loss scenario. This finding was supported by the qualitative data: risk-averse comments were more frequent in the gain frame whereas risk-seeking statements were more common in the loss frame. There was also evidence that lawyers may be less affected by framing than nonlawyers, although a smaller difference was observed than in previous studies. In addition, lawyers were more likely than nonlawyers to consider the expected financial value of the litigation in making their decision. We discuss the implications of these results and suggest avenues for future research.",21 July 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 3", 578-600,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12050
256,Playing with Trolleys: Intuitions About the Permissibility of Aggregation,"Mark Kelman, Tamar Admati Kreps","We explore when experimental subjects think aggregation across persons—deciding that some parties should be worse off, so that others might gain more, compared to an alternative option—is permissible through subjects' responses to trolley problem vignettes. Two classic vignettes are: (1) whether to divert a runaway trolley on to a spur track, killing one, to save multiple potential victims on a main track, and (2) whether to push an overweight person off a bridge to block the trolley from hitting the potential victims. Subjects typically judge diverting in the first problem permissible and pushing in the second problem impermissible. We first show that respondents reject Taurek's claim that the number of victims is irrelevant. Our central novel finding is that the intuition to distinguish the two cases is weaker than the extensive literature emphasizing its significance has implied. Responses to the two problems often converge to a significant extent on the position that aggregation is impermissible because the intuition to divert is both more weakly held and more subject to revision than the intuition against pushing. We show this convergence when the problems are presented together. Moreover, while the strictures against pushing are typically seen as mandatory (and hold even when following the strictures disadvantages kin or more identified parties), the obligation to divert is rarely unqualifiedly mandatory, and even its permissibility is sensitive to potential harm to kin and identifiable people.",11 April 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 2", 197-226,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12039

258,"Jurists, Clerics, and Merchants: The Rise of Learned Law in Medieval Europe and its Impact on Economic Growth","Hans-Bernd Schäfer, Alexander J. Wulf","Between the years 1200 and 1600, economic development in Catholic Europe gained momentum. By the end of this period, per-capita income levels were well above the income levels in all other regions of the world. We relate this unique development to the resurrection of Roman law, the rise of canon law, and the establishment of law as a scholarly and scientific discipline taught in universities. We test two competing hypotheses on the impact of these processes on economic growth in medieval Europe. The first conjecture is that the spread of substantive Roman law was conducive to the rise of commerce and economic growth. The second and competing conjecture is that growth occurred not as a result of the reception of substantive Roman law but because of the rational, scientific, and systemic features of Roman and canon law and the training of jurists in the newly established universities (Verwissenschaftlichung). This gave the law throughout Europe an innovative flexibility, which also influenced merchant law (lex mercatoria), and customary law. Using data on the population of more than 200 European cities as a proxy for per-capita income, we find that an important impact for economic development was not primarily the content of Roman law, but the rise of law faculties in universities and the emergence of a legal method developed by glossators and commentators in their interpretation and systematization of the sources of Roman law (Corpus Juris Civilis, Digests) and canon law. The endeavor to extract general normative conclusions from these sources led to abstraction, methodology, and the rise of law as a scholarly discipline. Wherever law faculties were founded anywhere in Europe, jurists learned new legal concepts and skills that were unknown before and conducive for doing business.",11 April 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 2", 266-300,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12041
259,Assuring Civil Damages Adequately Deter: A Public Good Experiment,"Theodore Eisenberg, Christoph Engel","To explore damages rules' deterrent effect we use a public good experiment to tailor punishment to rules used in civil litigation. The experimental treatments are analogous to: (1) damages limited to harm to an individual, (2) damages limited to harm to a group, such as in class actions, and (3) treble damages. For (1) and (2) we also manipulate the probability of a player being entitled to claim damages. The treatments with damages limited to harm to an individual do not prevent deterioration in cooperation over time but deterioration is slower. In the class action treatment, cooperation is stable over time if the probability of having to pay damages is sufficiently high. The same holds for the treble damages treatment. The results persist in variations of (1) and (2) in which the player imposing damages may have them forfeited with no benefit to her. We can therefore rule out that the beneficial effect of sanctions hinges on the participants knowing that the player imposing sanctions cannot intend to enrich herself.",11 April 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 2", 301-349,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12042
260,Shifting the Fat-Tailed Distribution of Blockbuster Punitive Damages Awards,"W. Kip Viscusi, Benjamin J. McMichael","The distribution of blockbuster punitive damages awards has fat tails similar to the distributions of losses from natural disasters. Extremely large awards occur more often and are more difficult to predict than if blockbuster awards were distributed normally. The size and predictability of awards are important factors in the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions on punitive damages. This article examines the effect of the Court's decision in State Farm v. Campbell on blockbuster punitive damages awards. State Farm shifts the fat tail of the distribution of blockbuster awards down (or “thins” the tail), which is consistent with a restraining effect on award size. State Farm reduces the size of blockbuster awards in general, but this reduction is most salient in the upper half of the distribution of awards. State Farm also has a negative influence on the probability of exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages. This article also examines the largest awards and considers why defendants may not pay large punitive damages awards.",11 April 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 2", 350-377,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12043
261,Does the Law Matter? Win Rates and Law Reforms,David Gliksberg,"The empirical legal study of tax law has developed greatly in recent years and has yielded many insights into the judiciary in particular and the legal system as a whole. This article continues this process by evaluating, through the prism of tax litigation and based on theories of analyzing judicial decision making, the effect of law reforms on win rates and whether win rates can help predict future law reforms. The analysis is based on a comprehensive database (census, not sample) of 1,330 tax decisions of the Israeli Supreme Court (ISC), divided into seven tax categories, and covering 60 years of tax jurisprudence since Israel's establishment (1948–2008). The data enabled us to find changes in win rates over time, among different tax categories, and in relation to several tax reforms. The detailed analysis found that law reforms have a significant effect on win rates and that win rates have a predictive ability for future law reform. These findings strengthen the legal model and the neo-institutional theory and do not provide support for selection effect theory or the attitudinal model regarding their explanatory function in analyzing judicial decisions.",11 April 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 2", 378-407,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12044
262,The Labor Market for New Law Professors,"Tracey E. George, Albert H. Yoon","Law school professors control the production of lawyers and influence the evolution of law. Understanding who is hired as a tenure-track law professor is of clear importance to debates about the state of legal education in the United States. But while opinions abound on the law school hiring process, little is empirically known about what explains success in the market for law professors. Using a unique and extensive data set of survey responses from candidates in the 2007–2008 legal academic labor market, we examine the factors that influence which candidates are interviewed and ultimately hired by law schools. We find that law schools appear open to nontraditional candidates in the early phases of the hiring process but when it comes to the ultimate decision—hiring—they focus on candidates who look like current law professors.",17 January 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 1", 1-38,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12033
263,Litigation and Social Capital: Divorces and Traffic Accidents in Japan,J. Mark Ramseyer,"Using regression and factor analysis with prefecture-level data, I ask whether Japanese in communities with high levels of “social capital” more readily settle their disputes out of court. Although studies of litigation rates often measure suits per capita, the more appropriate measure may involve suits per “dispute.” We lack information about the number of disputes in many fields, but we do have it for Japanese divorces and traffic accidents—and I focus on those two sets of disputes. Disputes over divorce and traffic accidents differ fundamentally, and social capital does not lower litigation rates among either. I find that: (1) couples in communities with low social capital are more apt to divorce; (2) couples in low-social-capital communities are not more likely to litigate their disputes; (3) couples in communities with more lawyers are not more likely to litigate their divorces; and (4) parties in communities with low social capital are not more likely to litigate their disputes over traffic accidents; but (5) parties in communities with more lawyers are indeed more likely to litigate their disputes over those accidents.",17 January 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 1", 39-73,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12034
264,Empirical Analysis of Data Breach Litigation,"Sasha Romanosky, David Hoffman, Alessandro Acquisti","In recent years, many lawsuits have been filed by individuals seeking legal redress for harms caused by the loss or theft of their personal information. However, very little is known about the drivers, mechanics, and outcomes of those lawsuits, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of litigation at balancing organizations' usage of personal data with individual privacy rights. Using a unique and manually collected database, we analyze court dockets for more than 230 federal data breach lawsuits from 2000 to 2010. We investigate two questions: Which data breaches are being litigated? and Which data breach lawsuits are settling? Our results suggest that the odds of a firm being sued are 3.5 times greater when individuals suffer financial harm, but 6 times lower when the firm provides free credit monitoring. Moreover, defendants settle 30 percent more often when plaintiffs allege financial loss, or when faced with a certified class action suit. By providing the first comprehensive empirical analysis of data breach litigation, our findings offer insight into the debate over privacy litigation versus privacy regulation.",17 January 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 1", 74-104,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12035
265,The Impact of Neuroimages in the Sentencing Phase of Capital Trials,"Michael J. Saks, N. J. Schweitzer, Eyal Aharoni, Kent A. Kiehl","Although recent research has found that neurological expert testimony is more persuasive than other kinds of expert and nonexpert evidence, no impact has been found for neuroimages beyond that of neurological evidence sans images. Those findings hold true in the context of a mens rea defense and various forms of insanity defenses. The present studies test whether neuroimages afford heightened impact in the penalty phase of capital murder trials. Two mock jury experiments (n = 825 and n = 882) were conducted online using nationally representative samples of persons who were jury eligible and death qualified. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions varying the defendant's diagnosis (psychopathy, schizophrenia, normal), type of expert evidence supporting the diagnosis (clinical, genetic, neurological sans images, neurological with images), evidence of future dangerousness (high, low), and whether the proponent of the expert evidence was the prosecution (arguing aggravation) or the defense (arguing mitigation). For defendants diagnosed as psychopathic, neuroimages reduced judgments of responsibility and sentences of death. For defendants diagnosed as schizophrenic, neuroimages increased judgments of responsibility; nonimage neurological evidence decreased death sentences and judgments of responsibility and dangerousness. All else equal, psychopaths were more likely to be sentenced to death than schizophrenics. When experts opined that the defendant was dangerous, sentences of death increased. A backfire effect was found such that the offering party produced the opposite result than that being argued for when the expert evidence was clinical, genetic, or nonimage neurological, but when the expert evidence included neuroimages, jurors moved in the direction argued by counsel.",17 January 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 1", 105-131,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12036
266,Jurisdictional Effects in M&A Litigation,"C. N. V. Krishnan, Ronald W. Masulis, Randall S. Thomas, Robert B. Thompson","We compile the most extensive hand-collected data set on all forms of M&A litigation in the United States to study the effects of lawsuit jurisdictions during a sample period (1999 and 2000) of the fifth merger wave, a period characterized by an abundance of friendly one-bidder deals and the near demise of the hostile offer. We find that only about 12 percent of all M&A offers are challenged in the courts during this period. Almost half the suits are filed in Delaware, while federal suits account for less than 9 percent of the suits in our sample. We find a very small incidence of multijurisdictional litigation (about 3 percent of all suits), unlike the recent sharp increase in such cases in the post-2008 global financial crisis period. We find that litigation filed in Delaware is less of a barrier to deal completion than cases brought in federal court. Litigation filed in federal court is associated with a significantly higher takeover premium in all offers and in completed deals, suggesting that state court cases, on average, put less pressure on bidders to raise takeover premia. In line with these findings, we find that federal courts attract a significantly higher proportion of target-initiated litigation than state courts; no target lawsuit is filed in Delaware during our sample period. Finally, we find that while jurisdiction does not significantly affect settlement rates or the consideration paid upon settlement, litigation challenging controlling shareholder squeezeouts is more likely to settle with cash consideration paid to shareholders, reflecting the stricter judicial standard applied to such bids.",17 January 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 1", 132-158,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12037

We describe and analyze both their original choice in this regard as well as change over time using a newly constructed data set comprised of 100 countries and covering the years between 1950 and 2005. Particularly robust findings are that former British colonies are less likely to address JI explicitly, as are states in the Caribbean. Electoral rules appear to matter and so does the form of government. A higher percentage of urban dwellers reduces the likelihood of mentioning JI in the constitution. Finally, we show that the likelihood that a constitution is altered with regard to JI is quite small: after a period of more than 50 years, 85 percent of all constitutions have remained unchanged in this regard.",17 January 2014,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 11, Issue 1", 159-195,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12038
268,The Receding Tide of Medical Malpractice Litigation: Part 1—National Trends,"Myungho Paik, Bernard Black, David A. Hyman","The United States has experienced three medical malpractice (med mal) crises in the past 40 years. In response, 31 states now have caps on noneconomic or total damages. Researchers have studied the impact of these caps, relative to control states without caps, but have not studied trends in no-cap states or overall national trends. We find that the per-physician rate of paid med mal claims has been dropping for 20 years and in 2012 was less than half the 1992 level. Lawsuit rates, in the states with available data, are also declining, at similar rates. “Small” paid claims (payout < $50,000 in 2011 dollars) have been dropping for the full period; “large” paid claims (payout ≥ $50,000) have been dropping since 2001. Payout per large paid claim was roughly flat. Payouts per physician have been dropping since 2003, and by 2012 were 48 percent below their 1992 level. The “third wave” of damage cap adoptions over 2003–2006 contributed to this trend, but there are also large declines in no-cap states.",23 October 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 4", 612-638,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12021

Prior studies found some evidence that caps reduce payout per claim, but mixed and weak evidence on whether caps reduce paid claim rates and payout per physician. However, most prior studies do not allow for the gradual phase-in of damage caps, which usually apply only to lawsuits filed after the reform's effective date, or only to injuries after the effective date. Once we allow for phase-in, we find strong evidence that damage caps reduce both claim rates and payout per claim, with a large combined impact on payout per physician. The drop in claim rates is concentrated in claims with larger payouts—the ones that we expect to be most affected by a damages cap. Stricter caps have larger effects. Some prior studies also find a large impact of tort reforms other than damage caps. Once we allow for phase-in, we find that these other reforms have no significant impact on either claim rates or payout per claim.",23 October 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 4", 639-669,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12022

Many groups of people, who hold seemingly controllable devalued traits, including gay men, the obese, and mothers, are discriminated against both in the labor force and in other areas of life. In this article, I show that perceptions of choice and controllability generate discrimination against individuals with seemingly controllable stigmatized traits. I use a hiring experiment in a highly controlled setting to assess this argument. The results provide strong evidence for a causal relationship between perceptions of choice and labor-force-type discrimination against gay men, obese men, and mothers. When the traits were presented as voluntary, gay men, obese men, and mothers were penalized when compared to their equally qualified counterparts in terms of hiring, salary recommendations, and competence evaluations.",23 October 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 4", 670-695,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12023

In the United States, the dominant form of accountability is that prosecutors must be reelected by the voters. Recent empirical work illustrates that election concerns open up the potential for distortion in the decision making of prosecutors. Specifically, it has been shown that prosecutors take more cases to trial and plea bargain less when running for reelection. Does this hawkish behavior of prosecutors lead to inaccuracies in the criminal justice system? A panel data set of appellate decisions in western New York is analyzed. It is shown that if the initial felony conviction takes place in the six months prior to a reelection and is appealed, the probability that the appellate court upholds the lower court's decision decreases by 5.1–7.1 percentage points. Additional investigation into the types of mistakes made is done. Thus, the popular election of prosecutors results in inaccurate sentences, wrongful convictions, and, consequently, successful appeals.",23 October 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 4", 696-714,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12024
272,Can You Buy Sperm Donor Identification? An Experiment,"I. Glenn Cohen, Travis G. Coan","In the United States, most sperm donations are anonymous. By contrast, many developed nations require sperm donors to be identified, typically requiring new sperm (and egg) donors to put identifying information into a registry that is made available to a donor-conceived child once he or she reaches the age of 18. Recently, advocates have pressed U.S. states to adopt these registries as well, and state legislatures have indicated openness to the idea. This study relies on a self-selected convenience sample to experimentally examine the economic implications of adopting a mandatory sperm donor identification regime in the United States. Our results support the hypothesis that subjects in the treatment (nonanonymity) condition need to be paid significantly more, on average, to donate their sperm. When restricting our attention to only those subjects who would ever actually consider donating sperm, we find that individuals in the control condition are willing to accept an average of $43 to donate, while individuals in the treatment group are willing to accept an average of $74. These estimates suggest that it would cost roughly $31 per sperm donation, at least in our sample, to require donors to be identified. This price differential roughly corresponds to that of a major U.S. sperm bank that operates both anonymous and identity release programs in terms of what it pays donors.",23 October 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 4", 715-740,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12025

We find a large (11 percentage points) racial gap in hold rates within a county. Judicial decisions are significantly influenced by the probability that the defendant will be rearrested pretrial for a violent felony. Controlling for this probability causes the racial gap in hold rates to disappear. Bail amounts follow the same pattern.

275,The Effect of Legal Expert Commentary on Lay Judgments of Judicial Decision Making,"Dan Simon, Nicholas Scurich","The public's view of the judiciary is a key factor in the legitimacy of any legal system. Ideally, popular judgments of the adjudicative branch would be independent of the outcomes of the decisions it furnishes. In a previous study (Simon & Scurich 2011), we found that lay people's evaluations of the judicial decision-making process were highly contingent on the decision outcomes. Participants gave favorable evaluations of the judges and their decisions when they agreed with the judges' outcomes, but reported negative evaluations when they disagreed with them. These results held true across four different types of judicial reasoning, and despite the fact that all decisions were described as having followed proper procedures and been argued by competent lawyers. That study left open the possibility that the public's judgments might be moderated by professional elites, namely, legal experts. Indeed, in real life, much of the public's information about judicial decisions is derived from legal experts who communicate and comment on them in the media. This study examined the effect of professional commentators on lay people's judgments of judicial decision making. We found that the experts' commentaries do not alter participants' evaluations of the courts' decisions, as the evaluations continue to be influenced strongly by the participants' agreement with the outcomes of the judges' decisions. Moreover, lay people's reactions to the experts follow a similar pattern: the experts are deemed competent and their commentaries are deemed reliable when the participants agree with the outcomes propounded by the experts, but the opposite is true when the participants' preferred outcomes are incongruent with the outcomes endorsed by the experts. These findings suggest that the outcome-dominated judgments of courts cannot easily be tempered by professional elites. This conclusion could also provide some insight into the dynamic process that enables political polarization.",23 October 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 4", 797-814,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12028

Using a set of provincial-level data over seven years (2003–2009), the article evaluates a number of hypotheses derived from extant theories of social litigiousness, state-society relations in authoritarian regimes, Chinese elite politics, and Chinese administrative law. It finds evidence that the rate of administrative litigation varies according to different levels of lawyer density and urbanization. It also finds preliminary evidence that casts doubt on the effects of top-down legal and policy changes in China. The article is the first longitudinal study of the Chinese administrative litigation system, and it answers questions that have long been underexplored. In addition, the research contributes to our understanding of state-society relations in authoritarian regimes. This article also evaluates the role of elite politics in the development of the administrative law regime and adds new evidence to the debate about lawyers' role in China's legal reforms.

277,Judicial Ideology and the Selection of Disputes for U.S. Supreme Court Adjudication,"Jeff Yates, Damon M. Cann, Brent D. Boyea","In political science, the well-known “attitudinal model” of legal decision making dictates that judges' sincere policy preferences drive legal outcomes. In contrast, the celebrated “selection hypothesis” from the law and economics literature suggests that litigants carefully consider factors affecting potential case success (including judicial ideology) and accordingly choose, in the name of efficiency, to settle or not pursue cases in which legal outcomes can be readily predicted. Thus, judges end up adjudicating a nonrandom set of cases that, in the typical situation, should not lend themselves to ideological judicial decision making. From this perspective, the influence of Supreme Court justices' ideological preferences on outcomes could be obviated by the forward-thinking decisions of mindful litigants. We are left with two dominant theories on jurisprudential outcomes that appear to be at odds with each other. We endeavor to address this situation by incorporating litigation case sorting considerations into a basic attitudinal account of Supreme Court justice decision making in environmental cases. Our primary thesis is that the influence of judicial ideology on legal outcomes is conditioned on case sorting decisions (by both litigants and justices) that precede the justices' voting decisions on the merits. We augment our assessment of this thesis by evaluating our basic model on a subset of cases involving the Court's most formidable litigator—the federal government. We find that in both scenarios, the influence of justices' attitudes on their merits voting is indeed conditioned on case sorting. We conclude that the effect of justices' attitudes on Supreme Court policy making likely works in both direct and indirect ways in that their known ideological proclivities may lead to the strategic sorting of cases for Supreme Court adjudication.",23 October 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 4", 847-865,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12030

280,Lawyers as Agents of the Devil in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game,"Orley Ashenfelter, David E. Bloom, Gordon B. Dahl","Do the parties in a typical dispute face incentives similar to those in the classic prisoner's dilemma game? In this article, we explore whether the costs and benefits of legal representation are such that each party seeks legal representation in the hope of exploiting the other party, while knowing full well that failing to do so will open up the possibility of being exploited. The article first shows how it is possible to test for the presence of such an incentive structure in a typical dispute resolution system. It then reports estimates of the incentives for the parties to obtain legal representation in wage disputes that were settled by final-offer arbitration in New Jersey. The article also reports briefly on similar studies of data from discharge grievances, court-annexed disputes in Pittsburgh, and child custody disputes in California. In each case, the data provide evidence that the parties face strong individual incentives to obtain legal representation that make the parties jointly worse off. Using our New Jersey data, we find that expert agents may well have played a productive role in moderating the biases of their clients, but only early on in the history of the system. Over time, the parties slowly evolved to a noncooperative equilibrium where the use of lawyers becomes nearly universal, despite the fact that agreeing not to hire lawyers is cheaper and does not appear to alter arbitration outcomes.",19 August 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 3", 399-423,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12014
281,Who Will Manage Complex Civil Litigation? The Decision to Transfer and Consolidate Multidistrict Litigation,"Margaret S. Williams, Tracey E. George","The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation may transfer factually related actions filed in different federal districts to a single judge for consolidated pretrial litigation. This transferee judge has significant discretion over the management of the litigation, including ruling on dispositive pretrial motions. Nearly all cases are resolved without returning to the original district court. Thus, as a practical matter, the MDL Panel controls where these disputes will be litigated. And, the MDL Panel has substantial discretion in making that decision. In its first 44 years of existence, the Panel has transferred and consolidated nearly 400,000 lawsuits, including high-profile securities and derivative lawsuits, large-scale consumer actions, and mass torts involving products liability claims, common disasters, and air crashes. The Panel's transfer ruling has never been overturned. The current study provides the first systematic and comprehensive empirical investigation of the Panel's decision to transfer and consolidate pending federal civil lawsuits, examining the rationale for transfer and for the selection of a specific district court and judge to handle the consolidated litigation. We find that the Panel grants most motions to transfer and consolidate, but exercises meaningful discretion in choosing where and by whom the cases will be adjudicated. The MDL Panel is much more likely to assign cases to a district court where a current panelist sits and that is supported by at least one defendant and to a district judge who currently serves on the Panel. Thus, the composition of the Panel has a meaningful effect on where and how large-scale litigation will be resolved.",19 August 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 3", 424-461,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12015
282,The Effects of the Labor Contract Law on the Chinese Labor Market,"Fan Cui, Ying Ge, Fengchun Jing","This article uses a micro-level data set to investigate the effect of China's Labor Contract Law, implemented in 2008, on the Chinese labor market. Our empirical evidence shows that the labor law reform significantly improved employee benefit. This effect is greater for state-owned enterprises, for large and domestic firms, and for regions with high unionization and high skill intensity. The Labor Contract Law significantly reduces the wage elasticity of labor demand, especially in highly unionized and skill-intensive industries. However, this effect is less significant in globalized industries and female-employee-intensive industries. Overall, our results emphasize the important role of China's Labor Contract Law in improving employment protection, and substantial variations in the impact of labor law reform across different firms, regions, and industries.",19 August 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 3", 462-483,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12016
283,"How Jurors Evaluate Fingerprint Evidence: The Relative Importance of Match Language, Method Information, and Error Acknowledgment","Brandon Garrett, Gregory Mitchell","Fingerprint examiners use a variety of terms and phrases to describe a finding of a match between a defendant's fingerprints and fingerprint impressions collected from a crime scene. Despite the importance and ubiquity of fingerprint evidence in criminal cases, no prior studies examine how jurors evaluate such evidence. We present two studies examining the impact of different match phrases, method descriptions, and statements about possible examiner error on the weight given to fingerprint identification evidence by laypersons. In both studies, the particular phrase chosen to describe the finding of a match—whether simple and imprecise or detailed and claiming near certainty—had little effect on participants' judgments about the guilt of a suspect. In contrast, the examiner admitting the possibility of error reduced the weight given to the fingerprint evidence—regardless of whether the admission was made during direct or cross-examination. In addition, the examiner providing information about the method used to make fingerprint comparisons reduced the impact of admitting the possibility of error. We found few individual differences in reactions to the fingerprint evidence across a wide range of participant variables, and we found widespread agreement regarding the uniqueness of fingerprints and the reliability of fingerprint identifications. Our results suggest that information about the reliability of fingerprint identifications will have a greater impact on lay interpretations of fingerprint evidence than the specific qualitative or quantitative terms chosen to describe a fingerprint match.",19 August 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 3", 484-511,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12017
284,Reference Points and Contractual Choices: An Experimental Examination,"Yuval Feldman, Amos Schurr, Doron Teichman","This article focuses on the influence of framing on the way people understand their contractual obligations. A large body of both psychological and economic studies suggests that people treat payoffs framed as gains and payoffs framed as losses distinctly. Building on these studies, we hypothesize that the ways parties understand their duties are affected by the way in which they are framed. More specifically, we expect that promisors will tend to adopt a more self-serving interpretation when they are making decisions in the domain of losses. To test this prediction, we run a series of four experiments that are all based on a between-subject design. The first two studies utilize experimental surveys that measure and compare participants' attitudes toward a contract interpretation dilemma. The third and fourth studies are incentive-compatible experiments, in which participants' actual interpretive decisions determine their payoff. All four experiments confirm our basic hypothesis and show that framing contractual payoffs as losses rather than as gains raises parties' tendency to interpret their obligations selfishly. These findings refine some of the previous understanding regarding the ability of penalties to optimize parties' contractual behavior, especially in situations in which monitoring is limited. Based on these findings, the article revisits some of the basic questions of contract law, shedding new light on an array of issues such as the law of liquidated damages and the optimal design of contracts.",19 August 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 3", 512-541,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12018
285,Rescuing Confidence in the Judicial System: Introducing Lay Participation in Taiwan,"Kuo-Chang Huang, Chang-Ching Lin","Using Taiwan's 2012 proposal as an illustration, this article discusses a new form of lay participation—the advisory jury—where a group of lay jurors make a collective decision without the professional judges' interference but such decision has no binding effect. This article analyzes how identifying promotion of the public's confidence in the judicial system rather than democratizing judicial decision making by legal elites as the reform purpose leads to the emergence of this form of lay participation. Through a newly conducted national survey, this study shows that the strong support for citizen participation indeed arises from popular dissatisfaction with judicial decision making by professional judges. However, merely half the public are willing to serve and significant disparities in willingness to serve exist across various demographic groups. Our empirical findings inform policymakers of important issues to be addressed in future implementation of citizen participation.",19 August 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 3", 542-569,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12019
286,A Quantitative Analysis of the Indian Supreme Court's Workload,Nick Robinson,"This article analyzes the Indian Supreme Court's docket in detail from 1993 to 2011. It also draws on available data to describe more broadly the workings of the Court before 1993. The article explains how deficiencies in the way data are currently collected and categorized by the Court presents challenges in developing a full picture of its workload. Using the admittedly imperfect data set, it then analyzes the Supreme Court's caseload by geographic region of appeal, subject matter category, petition type, and other classifications. Among other findings, this analysis shows that the Court is disproportionately accessed by those close to Delhi and with more resources and that the Supreme Court's multiplicity of benches and cases may be undercutting precedent following in the Indian judicial system.",19 August 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 3", 570-601,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12020
287,Do Racial Preferences Affect Minority Learning in Law Schools?,Doug Williams,"An analysis of the The Bar Passage Study (BPS) reveals that minorities are both less likely to graduate from law school and less likely to pass the bar compared to whites even after adjustments are made for group differences in academic credentials. To account for these adjusted racial gaps in performance, some researchers put forward the “mismatch hypothesis,” which proposes that students learn less when placed in learning environments where their academic skills are much lower than the typical student. This article presents new results from the BPS that account for both measurement-error bias and selection-on-unobservables bias that makes it more difficult to find a mismatch effect if in fact one exists. I find much more evidence for mismatch effects than previous research and report magnitudes from mismatch effects more than sufficient to explain racial gaps in performance.",18 April 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 2", 171-195,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12007
288,Price Effects and the Commerce Clause: The Case of State Wine Shipping Laws,"Jerry Ellig, Alan E. Wiseman","In the wake of Granholm v. Heald, numerous states passed new laws to regulate interstate direct shipment of alcohol that would seem to contradict the spirit, if not the explicit content, of the Commerce Clause. We build on existing scholarship analyzing the empirical impacts of direct shipment barriers to identify how these new laws are likely to influence local market conditions. Drawing on new data that measure posted winery prices and aggregate production levels in 2002 and 2004, we demonstrate how many of these new laws would be expected to effectively diminish, if not altogether remove, the benefits that would normally accrue to consumers from legalized interstate direct shipment of wine. Although empirical analysis of price effects currently plays a very limited role in dormant Commerce Clause cases, our analysis suggests how price data can be used to ascertain whether a state restriction constitutes discrimination against out-of-state economic interests.",18 April 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 2", 196-229,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12008
289,Can We Trust Intuitive Jurors? Standards of Proof and the Probative Value of Evidence in Coherence-Based Reasoning,"Andreas Glöckner, Christoph Engel","Jury members are confronted with highly complex, ill-defined problems. Coherence-based reasoning (Pennington & Hastie 1992; Simon 2004), which partially relies on intuitive-automatic processing, empowers them to nonetheless make meaningful decisions. These processes, however, have a downside. We tested possible negative effects in a set of studies. Specifically, we investigated whether stricter standards of proof are suppressed by stronger coherence shifts and whether the probative value of the evidence is properly taken into account. We found that U.S. model jury instructions for preponderance of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt influence conviction rates in the intended direction and are not undermined by coherence shifts, although probabilistic estimations of these standards are inappropriate. However, even massive changes in explicitly stated probabilities, while holding the overall constellation of facts constant, did not influence conviction rates or the estimated probability of conviction. We argue that reforms in legal procedure should focus on measures to reduce the negative side effects of coherence-based reasoning in general but, more specifically, to make probabilistic information better evaluable for decisionmakers in law.",18 April 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 2", 230-252,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12009

We utilize spectral cluster analysis on a newly compiled federal district court data set of causes of action in complaints to illustrate the relationship of legal claims to one another, the broader composition of lawsuits in trial courts, and the breadth of pleading in individual complaints. Our results shed light not only on the networks of legal theories in civil litigation but also on how lawsuits are classified and the strategies that plaintiffs and their attorneys employ when commencing litigation. This approach permits us to lay the foundation for a more precise and useful taxonomy of federal litigation than has been previously available, one that, after the Supreme Court's recent decisions in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly (2007) and Ashcroft v.

This has become especially relevant due to criticisms of financial market regulation in the United States. I test the impact of imposing strong laws on a weak regulatory environment by using China's principled reforms to market manipulation law as a natural experiment. The results from difference-in-difference tests suggest that China's principled law reforms did not improve the market's information environment, as proxied by the level of informed trade and information asymmetry. This implies that principled law reform is ineffective if the regulatory environment is weak.",18 April 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 2", 288-324,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12011
292,The Citation and Depreciation of U.S. Supreme Court Precedent,"Ryan C. Black, James F. Spriggs II","An enduring piece of legal wisdom contends that the value of court opinions depreciates as they age and a variety of factors lead some cases to depreciate faster than others. We measure depreciation as the change in the frequency with which Supreme Court cases are cited as a function of their age. We then examine whether the rate of depreciation varies systematically based on ideological considerations, opinion characteristics, and citation history. Our results indicate, first, that precedents depreciate rather quickly and, for example, depreciate about 81 percent and 85 percent between their first and 20th years of age at the Supreme Court and courts of appeals, respectively. Second, few of the variables in our analysis have any appreciable influence on the pace of depreciation. Two variables capturing the citation history of a case have the most notable influence on depreciation, but even their effects are reasonably modest and somewhat short-lived. Third, while our study focuses on depreciation (i.e., the change in the frequency of citation over time), it also produces an important implication for citation itself (i.e., the number of times a case is cited in a given year). We show that prior studies significantly overestimate the effect of almost every variable used to explain citation rates because those variables become substantially less influential as cases age. Future studies must therefore take into account that the effect of an independent variable on citations is conditional on the age of a precedent. This study therefore contributes to our understanding of the process by which law, as observed through citations to cases, changes.",18 April 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 2", 325-358,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12012
293,Do Jurors Give Appropriate Weight to Forensic Identification Evidence?,"William C. Thompson, Suzanne O. Kaasa, Tiamoyo Peterson","Do jurors give appropriate weight to forensic identification evidence? When judging the value of forensic evidence, are they sensitive to the probability of a false match? To answer these questions, we conducted two jury simulation experiments—the first with undergraduate participants, the second with members of a county jury pool. The experiments examined the weight that participants gave to forensic DNA evidence relative to Bayesian norms when evaluating a hypothetical criminal case. We found that aggregate judgments were generally consistent with Bayesian expectations, although people overvalued the DNA evidence when the probability of a false report of a match was high relative to the random match probability. Judgments of the chances the defendant was guilty varied appropriately in response to the variation in the probability of a false report of a match, as did verdicts. Our findings refute claims that jurors are always conservative Bayesians when evaluating forensic evidence and suggest, instead, that they use a variety of judgmental strategies and sometimes engage in fallacious statistical reasoning. In light of these findings, we identify circumstances in which forensic evidence may be overutilized, discuss implications for legal policy, and suggest additional lines of research.",18 April 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 2", 359-397,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12013
294,Measuring Diversity on the Supreme Court with Biodiversity Statistics,"Benjamin H. Barton, Emily Moran","This article aims to accomplish two goals. The first is to introduce some of the more common statistical measures of biodiversity to the empirical study of law. The second is to measure the diversity of background on the current Supreme Court using diversity indices commonly used in ecology. We treat the Supreme Court as if it is an ecosystem, and life experiences and traits as if they are different species, and ask whether diversity in seven categories (race/ethnicity, religion, professional background, geographic background, economic background, education, and political party) has grown or shrunk over time. We then combine these categories to create a single overall diversity measure. The results demonstrate that although the current Supreme Court is more diverse overall than the long-term historical average, there has been a recent downward trend in overall diversity, driven by decreases in diversity of educational background, geographic background, and, to a lesser extent, religious diversity. However, diversity of professional background and of childhood economic background has remained high in recent years, and racial diversity has increased greatly.",18 January 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 1", 1-34,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12000

Case information from all jury trials held during the time was collected and empirically analyzed with a focus on judge-jury agreement. The statistical analyses were guided by previous studies (Eisenberg et al. 2005; Spencer 2007). Results indicated that judges and juries agreed on the verdict 91.4 percent of the time (70.3 percent for conviction and 21.1 percent for acquittal). When they disagreed, juries had a greater tendency to acquit than did judges (7.4 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively). Neither evidentiary strength nor complexity had any systematic impact on agreement rates. Judges were more likely than juries to convict across all levels of evidentiary strength. The accuracy and error rates of jury verdicts were assessed by estimates of conditional probability.",18 January 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 1", 35-53,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12001

We argue that the certiorari process cannot be modeled as an independent one; rather, it is inextricably linked with and essentially contingent on the behavior of litigants who bring the case to the Supreme Court. This dependence of the Court is important both at the level of theory and at the empirical level and ignoring it entails bias in the estimation process. Using an original database, which includes the universe of religion free exercise cases decided at the courts of appeals from 1968–2006, we find significant selection effects. Factors that influence decisions on certiorari are dependent on the behavior of petitioners and should be modeled as such.",18 January 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 1", 54-75,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12002

This concern reflects the changing environments of courts, especially elected state courts, and what might generally be termed the politicization of the judiciary. The purpose of this article is to assess the effectiveness of judicial recusals at rehabilitating a court/judge tainted by perceived conflicts of interest associated with campaign activities by litigants. Based on an experimental design embedded in a nationally representative sample, our data first confirm that direct campaign contributions undermine perceptions of fairness; but, unexpectedly, so, too, does independent support for the candidate. Most important, recusal does indeed restore some perceived fairness; unfortunately, the repair to public perceptions is not to the level enjoyed when no conflict of interest exists. In a post-Citizens United world, these findings therefore point to significant threats to the legitimacy of elected state courts.",18 January 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 1", 76-103,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12003

For this purpose, we use data on pain and suffering verdicts in Austria, where courts are generally free to choose between a per-diem and a lump-sum scheme to assess damages for pain and suffering. The per-diem approach was introduced in 1990 but was not adopted in all Austrian provincial courts. This enables us to estimate the causal impact of the change in calculation schemes. Applying a difference-in-difference framework to estimate this treatment effect, we observe that courts increased their compensation by about 38 percent to 59 percent after the implementation of the per-diem scheme.",18 January 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 1", 104-119,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12004

We find that the stronger parties not only win more often, but also do so by a large margin. Overall, institutional litigants fare better than individual litigants. When the litigants are classified by their organizational and social status, government agencies or government-related companies are the biggest winners, enjoying an enormous advantage, and farmers are the most disadvantaged underdogs, with other individuals and companies in between. When controlling for legal representation, these winning gaps remain significant and sizable. The edge of the stronger parties recurs across categories of cases in different issue areas of the law. Echoing previous comparative studies, we cast doubt on the party capability theory. We speculate that the causes of judicial inequality in China lie not only in resource gaps but also in the roots of the law and the nature of the court.",18 January 2013,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 10, Issue 1", 120-145,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jels.12005
300,Bridging the Empirical Gap: New Insights into the Experience of Multiple Legal Problems and Advice Seeking,"Marisol Smith, Alexy Buck, Judith Sidaway, Lesley Scanlan","There is a substantial body of quantitative evidence that documents the incidence of legal problem clusters, the tendency of problems to occur together. It has also been shown that some people are at greater risk of multiple problem experience than others, in particular, disadvantaged groups. Various policy initiatives, most recently in England and Wales, have been implemented to address the links between civil legal problems. However, to date there has been little empirical research on how clients present with clusters and the success of legal advisors in detecting multiple problems, including the barriers and facilitators that might be relevant. This article presents findings from an extensive empirical study on Community Legal Advice Centres, which were introduced in England and Wales to deliver integrated advice provision. The data are drawn from a triangulated qualitative study comprising advice session observations, and first and follow-up interviews with clients and advisors. The data confirm the existence of problem clusters, but provide a new dimension to research on problem clusters by demonstrating in detail how and why multiple problems are difficult to detect.

Coates IV,"How did corporate politics, governance, and value relate to each other in the S&P 500 before and after Citizens United? In regulated and government-dependent industries, politics is nearly universal, and uncorrelated with shareholder power, agency costs, or value. However, 11 percent of CEOs in 2000 who retired by 2011 obtained political positions after retiring and, in most industries, political activity correlates negatively with measures of shareholder power, positively with signs of agency costs, and negatively with shareholder value. The politics-value relationship interacts with capital expenditures, and is stronger in regressions with firm and time fixed effects, which absorb many omitted variables. After the shock of Citizens United, corporate lobbying and PAC activity jumped, in both frequency and amount, and firms politically active in 2008 had lower value in 2010 than other firms, consistent with politics at least partly causing and not merely correlating with lower value.

Schanzenbach","The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines restrict judicial discretion in part to reduce unwarranted racial disparities. However, judicial discretion may also mitigate disparities if judges use discretion to offset disparities emanating from prosecutorial discretion or sentencing policies that have a disparate impact. To measure the impact of judicial discretion on racial disparities, we examine doctrinal changes that affected judges' discretion to depart from the Guidelines. We find that racial disparities are either reduced or little changed when the Guidelines are made less binding. Racial disparities increased after recent Supreme Court decisions declared the Guidelines to be advisory; however, we find that this increase is due primarily to the increased relevance of mandatory minimums, which have a disparate impact on minority offenders. Our findings suggest that judicial discretion does not contribute to, and may in fact mitigate, racial disparities in Guidelines sentencing.",06 November 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 4", 729-764,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01266.x

How much of their future is predicted by their social class? The law school they attend? Their law school grades? This article undertakes the first in-depth examination of these questions. Drawing on several large and recently released data sets, we examine the role of class, school prestige, and law school grades on the career earnings of lawyers and the success of big firm associates in becoming partners. We find that social class strongly conditions who goes to law school, but no longer predicts much about postgraduate outcomes. Law school prestige is important, but it is generally trumped by law school performance (as measured by law school grades). Law school grades reflect both personal characteristics not well captured by prelaw credentials, and one's relative position in a law school class as measured by prelaw credentials.

304,Is Delaware Losing its Cases?,"John Armour, Bernard Black, Brian Cheffins","Delaware's expert courts are seen as an integral part of the state's success in attracting incorporation by public companies. However, the benefit that Delaware companies derive from this expertise depends on whether corporate lawsuits against Delaware companies are brought before the Delaware courts. We report evidence that these suits are increasingly brought outside Delaware. We investigate changes in where suits are brought using four hand-collected data sets capturing different types of suits: class action lawsuits filed in (1) large M&A and (2) leveraged buyout transactions over 1994–2010; (3) derivative suits alleging option backdating; and (4) cases against public company directors that generate one or more publicly available opinions between 1995 and 2009. We find a secular increase in litigation rates for all companies in large M&A transactions and for Delaware companies in LBO transactions. We also see trends toward (1) suits being filed outside Delaware in both large M&A and LBO transactions and in cases generating opinions; and (2) suits being filed both in Delaware and elsewhere in large M&A transactions. Overall, Delaware courts are losing market share in lawsuits, and Delaware companies are gaining lawsuits, often filed elsewhere. We find some evidence that the timing of specific Delaware court decisions that affect plaintiffs' firms coincides with the movement of cases out of Delaware. Our evidence suggests that serious as well as nuisance cases are leaving Delaware.

Darley","In a series of experimental studies, we asked people to assign appropriate civil and/or criminal liability to individuals who cause harm with various culpable states of mind and kinds of knowledge. The studies are principally aimed at two related issues. First, do people actually separate the various states of mind conceptually? How much knowledge, and what kind of knowledge, regarding something that may go wrong (understanding risk) is sufficient to count as knowing that something will go wrong (having knowledge legally equivalent to intent)? Second, to the extent that people distinguish among the states of mind that help define normative behavior, how much do those distinctions contribute to people's judgments of civil liability? Our studies show that people are able to make explicit distinctions about the states of mind of others that more or less correspond to legally relevant categories. Yet, when asked to assign consequences, their “hot” moral judgments play a larger role than do their “cold” cognitive categorizations.",06 November 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 4", 859-892,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01269.x

We focus on administrative review. The evidence seems to confirm that a career judiciary is not strongly politically aligned and favors consensus, formalism, and dissent avoidance. Notwithstanding, we detect a significant relationship between the decisions of the Court and the interest of the government.

Joseph Warburton,"This article explores the effects of competition on risk-taking behavior and firm performance within the financial services industry. It does so by exploiting a regulatory change that allowed new players to enter the British mutual fund industry. Exploiting this regulatory shock, we trace nontrivial linkages among industry competition, risk taking, and performance. Greater competition followed the regulatory liberalization, leading to a significant increase in risk-taking behavior of funds. Competition generated performance efficiencies, forcing underperforming funds to exit and halting earlier value destruction. Competition, however, did not produce tangible cost savings for consumers of investment services.",06 November 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 4", 827-858,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01271.x
308,Race and Selective Enforcement in Public Housing,"Jeffrey Fagan, Garth Davies, Adam Carlis","Drugs, crime, and public housing are closely linked in policy and politics, and their nexus has animated several intensive drug enforcement programs targeted at public housing residents. In New York City, police systematically conduct “vertical patrols” in public housing buildings, making tens of thousands of Terry stops each year. During these patrols, both uniformed and undercover officers systematically move through the buildings, temporarily detaining and questioning residents and visitors, often at a low threshold of suspicion, and usually alleging trespass to justify the stop. We use a case-control design to identify the effects of living in one of New York City's 330 public housing developments on the probability of stop, frisk, and arrest from 2004–2011. We find that the incidence rate ratio for trespass stops and arrests is more than two times greater in public housing than in the immediate surrounding neighborhoods. We decompose these effects using first differences models and find that the difference in percent black and Hispanic populations in public housing compared to the surrounding area predicts the disparity in trespass enforcement and enforcement of other criminal law violations. The pattern of racially selective enforcement suggests the potential for systemic violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition on racial discrimination.",06 November 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 4", 697-728,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01272.x
309,The Effect of Blinded Experts on Juror Verdicts,"Christopher T. Robertson, David V. Yokum","“Blind expertise” has been proposed as an institutional solution to the problem of bias in expert witness testimony in litigation (Robertson 2010). At the request of a litigant, an intermediary selects a qualified expert and pays the expert to review a case without knowing which side requested the opinion. This article reports an experiment that tests the hypothesis that, compared to traditional experts, such “blinded experts” will be more persuasive to jurors. A national sample of mock jurors (N = 275) watched an online video of a staged medical malpractice trial, including testimony from two medical experts, one of whom (or neither, in the control condition) was randomly assigned to be a blind expert. We also manipulated whether the judge provided a special jury instruction explaining the blinding concept. Descriptively, the data suggest juror reluctance to impose liability. Despite an experimental design that included negligent medical care, only 46 percent of the jurors found negligence in the control condition, which represents the status quo. Blind experts, testifying on either side, were perceived as significantly more credible, and were more highly persuasive, in that they doubled (or halved) the odds of a favorable verdict, and increased (or decreased) simulated damages awards by over $100,000. The increased damages award appears to be due to jurors hedging their damages awards, which interacted with the blind expert as a driver of certainty. Use of a blind expert may be a rational strategy for litigants, even without judicial intervention in the form of special jury instructions or otherwise.",06 November 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 4", 765-794,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01273.x

Using a unique data set of consumer-level monthly billing and usage information for 3,730 consumers at a single wireless provider, we evaluate the explanatory power of three accounts of the three-part tariff: a rational choice account; a behavioral account proposed by Grubb (2009) that supposes that consumers are overconfident in their estimates of their future usage; and a second behavioral account that posits that some consumers overestimate their average future usage while others underestimate it. We quantify the mistakes that consumers make in plan choice and, extrapolating from our data, estimate that these mistakes cost U.S. consumers over $13 billion annually. Our analysis suggests that regulation mandating the disclosure of product use information can be socially desirable in the cell phone service market.",23 July 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 3", 430-456,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01258.x
312,Defensive Medicine and Obstetric Practices,Michael Frakes,"Using data on physician behavior from the 1979–2005 National Hospital Discharge Surveys (NHDS), I estimate the relationship between malpractice pressure, as identified by the adoption of noneconomic damage caps and related tort reforms, and certain decisions faced by obstetricians during the delivery of a child. The NHDS data, supplemented with restricted geographic identifiers, provides inpatient discharge records from a broad enough span of states and covering a long enough period of time to allow for a defensive medicine analysis that draws on an extensive set of variations in relevant tort laws. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, I find no evidence to support the claim that malpractice pressure induces physicians to perform a substantially greater number of cesarean sections. Extending this analysis to certain additional measures, however, I do find some evidence consistent with positive defensive behavior among obstetricians. For instance, I estimate that the adoption of a noneconomic damage cap is associated with a reduction in the utilization of episiotomies during vaginal deliveries, without a corresponding change in observed neonatal outcomes.",23 July 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 3", 457-481,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01259.x

Griffith","This article develops models that predict the incidence and amount of settlements for federal class action securities fraud litigation in the post-PLSRA period. We build hierarchical Bayesian models using data that come principally from Riskmetrics and identify several important predictors of settlement incidence (e.g., the number of different types of securities associated with a case, the company return during the class period) and settlement amount (e.g., market capitalization, measures of newsworthiness). Our models also allow us to estimate how the circuit court a case is filed in as well as the industry of the plaintiff firm associate with settlement outcomes. Finally, they allow us to accurately assess the variance of individual case outcomes revealing substantial amounts of heterogeneity in variance across cases.",23 July 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 3", 482-510,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01260.x
314,Transferring Trust: Reciprocity Norms and Assignment of Contract,Tess Wilkinson-Ryan,"This article presents four experiments testing the prediction that assignment of contract rights erodes the moral obligation to perform. The first three studies used an experimental laboratory game designed to model contractual exchange. Players in the games were less selfish with a previously generous partner than with a third-party player who had purchased the right to the original partner's expected return. The fourth study used a web-based questionnaire, and found that subjects reported that they would require less financial incentive to breach an assigned contract than a contract held by the original promisee. The results of these four experiments provide support for the proposition that a permissible and apparently neutral transfer of a contractual right may nonetheless reduce the likelihood or quality of performance by weakening the norm of reciprocity.",23 July 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 3", 511-535,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01261.x
315,Arbitration Clauses in Credit Card Agreements: An Empirical Study,"Christopher R. Drahozal, Peter B. Rutledge","This article uses a newly available database of consumer credit card agreements to take the first, in-depth empirical look at why credit card issuers use arbitration clauses. Based on a sample of credit card agreements made available by 298 issuers under the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, it finds that while most credit card agreements include arbitration clauses, the substantial majority of credit card issuers (247 of 298, or 82.9 percent) do not use arbitration clauses in their credit card agreements. The article also finds that credit card issuers are more likely to use arbitration clauses when they (1) specialize in making credit card loans; (2) make riskier credit card loans; and (3) have a larger credit card portfolio. Conversely, issuers are less likely to use arbitration clauses when they are (1) mutually owned (i.e., credit unions) rather than shareholder owned (i.e., banks); and (2) are located in states in which class arbitration waivers are unenforceable. These empirical findings have potentially important implications for a number of timely policy questions, such as: What sorts of options are available to consumers who wish to obtain a credit card that is not subject to an arbitration clause? How might increased regulation of arbitration (whether by Congress or by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) affect the market for credit card loans? and How are businesses likely to respond to the Supreme Court's recent decision in AT&T Mobility LLC v.

316,Does Tort Law Deter Individuals? A Behavioral Science Study,"W. Jonathan Cardi, Randall D. Penfield, Albert H. Yoon","For nearly four decades, economic analysis has dominated academic discussion of tort law. Courts also have paid increasing attention to the potential deterrent effects of their tort decisions. But at the center of each economic model and projection of cost and benefit lies a widely accepted but grossly undertested assumption that tort liability in fact deters tortious conduct. This article reports the results of a behavioral science study that tests this assumption as it applies to individual conduct. Surveying over 700 first-year law students, the study presented a series of vignettes, asking subjects to rate the likelihood that they would engage in a variety of potentially tortious behaviors under different legal conditions. Students were randomly assigned one of four surveys, which differed only in the legal rules applicable to the vignettes. In summary, the study found that although the threat of potential criminal sanctions had a large and statistically significant effect on subjects' stated willingness to engage in risky behavior, the threat of potential tort liability did not. These findings call into question widely accepted notions about the very foundations of tort law.",23 July 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 3", 567-603,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01263.x
317,"Race, Attorney Influence, and Bankruptcy Chapter Choice","Jean Braucher, Dov Cohen, Robert M. Lawless","We report on racially disparate uses of Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Currently, approximately 1,500,000 bankruptcy petitions are filed each year, with about 30 percent of those petitions being Chapter 13 cases. Although Chapter 13 can offer some legal advantages for persons seeking to protect valuable assets such as a house or automobile, it generally offers less relief and costs more than the primary alternative available to consumers, Chapter 7. The chief feature of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case is a plan under which the debtor must devote all his or her disposable income to creditor repayment over a three- to five-year period. Chapter 7, in contrast, requires only that the debtor turn over all nonexempt assets, with over 90 percent of Chapter 7 debtors having no assets to turn over. This article reports on two studies, one using data from actual bankruptcy cases and the other involving an experiment with a national random sample of bankruptcy attorneys. Because the court system does not collect racial data on bankruptcy filers, the first study uses data from the Consumer Bankruptcy Project. Even after controlling for financial, demographic, and legal factors that might favor a Chapter 13 filing, African Americans are much more likely to file Chapter 13, as compared to debtors of other races. The second study reports on an experimental vignette sent to a random sample of consumer bankruptcy attorneys who represented debtors. The attorneys were more likely to recommend Chapter 13 when the hypothetical debtors were a couple named “Reggie & Latisha,” who attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church, as compared to a couple named “Todd & Allison,” who attended a United Methodist Church. Also, attorneys viewed “Reggie & Latisha” as having better values and being more competent when they expressed a preference for Chapter 13 as compared to “Todd & Allison,” who were seen as having better values and being more competent when they wanted to file Chapter 7, giving them a “fresh start.” Previous research and the results from the present experimental vignette study suggest that consumer bankruptcy attorneys may be playing a very important, although likely unintentional, role in creating the racial disparity in chapter choice. Together, the two studies raise questions about the fairness of the bankruptcy system.",23 July 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 3", 393-429,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01264.x
318,Will Tort Reform Bend the Cost Curve? Evidence from Texas,"Myungho Paik, Bernard S. Black, David A. Hyman, Charles Silver","Will tort reform “bend the cost curve?” Health-care providers and tort reform advocates insist the answer is “yes.” They claim that defensive medicine is responsible for hundreds of billions of dollars in health-care spending every year. If providers and reform advocates are right, once damages are capped and lawsuits are otherwise restricted, defensive medicine, and thus overall health-care spending, will fall substantially. We study how Medicare spending changed after Texas adopted comprehensive tort reform in 2003, including a strict damages cap. We compare Medicare spending in Texas counties with high claim rates (high risk) to spending in Texas counties with low claim rates (low risk), since tort reform should have a greater impact on physician incentives in high-risk counties. Pre-reform, Medicare spending levels and trends were similar in high- and low-risk counties. Post-reform, we find no evidence that spending levels or trends in high-risk counties declined relative to low-risk counties and some evidence of increased physician spending in high-risk counties. We also compare spending trends in Texas to national trends, and find no evidence of reduced spending in Texas post-reform, and some evidence that physician spending rose in Texas relative to control states. In sum, we find no evidence that Texas's tort reforms bent the cost curve downward.",07 May 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 2", 173-216,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01251.x

Subramanian, Michelle M. Mello","Previous research has identified an association between malpractice liability risk levels in a state and greater use of cesarean sections in obstetrical care. However, it is unclear whether such practice changes are associated with better birth outcomes. Using a mixed-effects model, we investigate the impact of malpractice risk, as measured by malpractice insurance premiums and various state tort reforms, on four adverse birth outcomes. We use a longitudinal research design to examine millions of individual births from 51 jurisdictions over 12 years (1991–2002). We find that the odds of adverse birth outcomes are not associated with premium levels or tort reforms. Our results suggest that rather than having a socially desirable deterrent effect on substandard care, liability pressure may produce a level of precaution taking in obstetrics that is higher than socially optimal. By the same token, the results also suggest that the adoption of liability-limiting reforms is unlikely to have an adverse impact on outcomes.",07 May 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 2", 217-245,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01252.x
320,Does the Judge Matter? Exploiting Random Assignment on a Court of Last Resort to Assess Judge and Case Selection Effects,"Theodore Eisenberg, Talia Fisher, Issi Rosen-Zvi","We study 1,410 mandatory jurisdiction and 48 discretionary jurisdiction criminal law case outcomes in cases appealed to the Israel Supreme Court in 2006 and 2007 to assess influences on case outcomes. A methodological innovation is accounting for factors—case specialization, seniority, and workload—that modify random case assignment. To the extent one accounts for nonrandom assignment, one can infer that case outcome differences are judge effects. In mandatory jurisdiction cases, individual justices cast 3,986 votes and differed by as much as 15 percent in the probability of casting a vote favoring defendants. Female justices were about 2 to 3 percent more likely than male justices to vote for defendants but this effect is sensitive to including one justice. Defendant gender was associated with outcome, with female defendants about 17 percent more likely than male defendants to receive a favorable vote on appeal. Our data's samples of mandatory and discretionary jurisdiction cases allow us to show that studies limited to discretionary jurisdiction case outcomes can distort perceptions of judges' preferences. Justices' ordinal rank in rate of voting for defendants or the state was uncorrelated across mandatory and discretionary jurisdiction cases. For example, the justice who sat on the most criminal cases was the fourth (of 16 justices) most favorable to the state in mandatory jurisdiction cases but the 12th most favorable in discretionary jurisdiction cases. This result casts doubt on some inferences based on studies of judges on discretionary jurisdiction courts, such as the U.S. Supreme Court, in which only discretionary case outcomes are observed.",07 May 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 2", 246-290,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01253.x
321,Sentencing Guidelines and Judicial Discretion: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Human Calculation Errors,"Shawn D. Bushway, Emily G. Owens, Anne Morrison Piehl","The extent to which rules set by the legislature bind or influence decisions regarding sentence length is central to institutional design and to determining the practical impact of any proposed reform regarding criminal punishment. However, it is generally difficult to identify empirically the impact of sentencing recommendations because court actors may have preferences that are correlated with those outlined in the guidelines. In this article, we take advantage of a new source of identification to study how government actors interact and make decisions in the criminal sentencing process. We identify instances in the Maryland circuit court in which the case facts are not consistent with the final sentence recommendation—inconsistencies that appear to be the result of human error and exogenous to the preferences of downstream actors. We find that even an advisory guidelines system like the one in Maryland has a direct impact on judicial decision making in cases involving drugs and violent crimes. Judges appear eager to go along with an erroneous lesser sentence for violent offenses. In contrast, judges appear to discount mistakes that are too high. This asymmetry does not occur for property and drug offenses that are simpler and more frequently encountered. More generally, experience matters. Error rates are lower for more frequently occurring offense types and lower for those court professionals who complete more of the sentencing worksheets. The net effect of sentencing guidelines on time served appears to be small because parole boards counteract the remaining influence of the guidelines.",07 May 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 2", 291-319,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01254.x

We extend our inquiry here by asking if Catholic school closures might also affect crime rates. Using factors independent from neighborhood indicators, specifically school and parish leadership characteristics, we created an exogenous factor that predicted which Catholic schools might close in urban Chicago, and used that factor, with sociodemographic variables, to predict police-beat-level crime rates. We find that Catholic school closures slow the rate of decline of crime in a police beat compared to beats with no Catholic school closure. We also find that higher perceived disorder predicted higher initial levels of crime. Our findings provide insight into which policing policies are effective and the benefits of involving religious institutions in crime-prevention efforts.

324,Institutional Activism Through Litigation: An Empirical Analysis of Public Pension Fund Participation in Securities Class Actions,Michael Perino,"The PSLRA's lead plaintiff provision enlisted institutional investors to monitor class counsel in order to curb the agency costs endemic in securities class actions. This article uses a sample of 731 settlements to examine the efficacy of this provision. It finds that, even when controlling for institutional self-selection of potentially easier or higher-quality cases, cases with public pension lead plaintiffs have larger recoveries and lower fee requests and fee awards than cases with other lead plaintiff types. The article also finds evidence consistent with the existence of a significant positive externality associated with public pension participation. Over time, fee requests and fee awards have on average declined significantly even in cases without such lead plaintiffs. These findings suggest that public pensions act as more effective monitors of class counsel than traditional plaintiffs and that the lead plaintiff provision has substantially reduced the transactions costs associated with securities class actions.",07 May 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 2", 368-392,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01257.x

The article finds large and statistically significant relations between ex post validity and both textual features of the patents and ex ante aspects of the prosecution history (especially prior art submissions and the existence of internal patent office appeals before issuance).

Residential stability and willingness to serve distinguished former jurors from those who had never been summoned or had never been questioned for a case. After controlling for age, neither race nor ethnicity accounted for participation, a finding replicated in data from another state.

In Canada, firms can enter the stock market at a prerevenue stage by fulfilling each of the requirements of an initial public offering or using reverse mergers. This backdoor listing method implies a smoother oversight by the securities commission and a shorter process based on private placements. Controlling for several dimensions, including self-selection, we find that the choice of the listing method and regulation strictness significantly influence the value and long-run performance of newly listed firms. These results are consistent with theories suggesting that a commitment by a firm to a stricter regulatory oversight lowers the information asymmetry component of the cost of capital, reducing the heterogeneity of expectations and mispricing.",15 February 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 1", 56-91,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01247.x
328,Delaware's Competitive Reach,"Matthew D. Cain, Steven M. Davidoff","Despite its dominance of the market for public company corporate charters, Delaware has come under increasing fire for losing ground to other states in the competition to retain corporate litigation. To test this criticism, we evaluate the selection of governing law and forum clauses in 1,020 merger agreements between public firms from 2004–2008. This sample provides a clean test of the real-time attractiveness of states' judiciary during the sample period. In contrast to prior research, we find that Delaware's attractiveness to merging parties has increased in recent years. Parties appear to respond to exogenous events, evidenced by the fact that top-tier legal advisors, foreign acquirers, transactions surrounded by greater financial uncertainty, and larger transactions tend to select Delaware's forum over other venues. We conclude that during our sample period, Delaware was increasingly valued by the corporate actors who influence incorporation choices, and competed strongly for legal products beyond its primary one, the public company charter. This is important because a failure to retain corporate litigation can possibly lead to an erosion in Delaware's prominence in the public company chartering market.",15 February 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 1", 92-128,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01248.x

Lindquist","Ideological models are widely accepted as the basis for many academic studies of the Supreme Court because of their power in predicting the justices' decision-making behavior. Not all votes are easily explained or well predicted by attitudes, however. Consensus in Supreme Court voting, particularly the extreme consensus of unanimity, has often puzzled Court observers who adhere to ideological accounts of judicial decision making. Are consensus and (ultimately) unanimity driven by extreme factual scenarios or extreme lower court rulings such that even the most liberal and most conservative justice can agree on the case disposition? Or are they driven by other, nonattitudinal influences on judicial decisions? In this article, we rely on a measure of deviations from expected ideological patterns in the justices' voting to assess whether ideological models provide an adequate explanation of consensus on the Court. We find that case factors that predict voting disorder also predict consensus. Based on that finding, we conclude that consensus on the Court cannot be explained by ideology alone; rather, it often results from ideology being outweighed by other influences on justices' decisions.",15 February 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 1", 129-148,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01249.x
330,Dirty Hands or Deterrence? An Experimental Examination of the Exclusionary Rule,Kenworthey Bilz,"Historically, the Supreme Court has offered two justifications for the exclusionary rule: (1) it protects the integrity of the judicial system from “dirty” evidence and (2) it deters illegal searches by the police. The former justification has mostly fallen out of favor. Today, decisions turn on whether the rule would, in fact, deter illegal searches in a given class of cases. As such, most empirical studies about the rule have focused on whether or not the rule leads to fewer police searches (illegal or otherwise), or to fewer criminal convictions. This study takes a completely different approach, assessing support for the two competing justifications for the rule. Two experiments show support for the integrity justification for the rule, but not for the deterrence justification. Specifically, when deciding whether to exclude evidence found during a search conducted without probable cause, participants are sensitive to a police officer's motive (clean vs. dirty), but not to alternative means of punishing those officers (civil suit, citizen-police review board). A third experiment examines the integrity rationale in more detail. Participants who were obligated to use dirty evidence at trial disproportionately selected a bottle of Purell over a pen as a thank-you gift versus participants who were able to exclude that evidence. In other words, the exclusionary rule seems to protect the courts from being metaphorically tainted. These findings are important given that the rule is not constitutionally mandated. The Supreme Court has held that the rule can be ignored to the extent that it (1) does not achieve its goals and (2) undermines the perceived legitimacy of the courts by the public. Given this, the Court needs to be right about what those goals are, and whether or not its current deterrence-based jurisprudence enhances legitimacy. These experiments suggest the possibility that reinvigorating the integrity justification would serve the ends of the rule better than current doctrine does.",15 February 2012,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 9, Issue 1", 149-171,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01250.x

334,If the Shoe Fits They Might Acquit: The Value of Forensic Science Testimony,Jonathan J. Koehler,"The probative value of forensic science evidence (such as a shoeprint) varies widely depending on how the evidence and hypothesis of interest is characterized. This article uses a likelihood ratio (LR) approach to identify the probative value of forensic science evidence. It argues that the “evidence” component should be characterized as a “reported match,” and that the hypothesis component should be characterized as “the matching person or object is the source of the crime scene sample.” This characterization of the LR forces examiners to incorporate risks from sample mixups and examiner error into their match statistics. But will legal decisionmakers be sensitive to the extent to which examiners' statistical testimony accounts for various potential sources of risk and error? A controlled experiment with 315 jury-eligible jurors who received a shoeprint match statistic in a hypothetical burglary case finds that, contrary to normative theory, people are more persuaded by statistical testimony that ignores various error risks than by testimony that is objectively stronger by virtue of taking those risks into account. The experiment also finds that jurors are relatively unresponsive to exposure of those risks by a defense attorney on cross-examination. These results support and extend previous research that finds many people are confused about how to evaluate the risk of error associated with expert forensic testimony.",22 November 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Judgment by the Numbers: Converting Qualitative to Quantitative Judgments in Law, 21-48,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01225.x

Following Ho and Liu (2010), we use the passage of state-level apology laws that exclude apologies from being used as evidence in medical malpractice cases, and estimate that apologizing to a patient in cases of medical malpractice litigation reduces the average payout by $32,000.

This article considers the disparate impact of the rules, rather than their implementation, by providing a quantitative assessment of the Maryland sentencing grid for person offenses using the distribution of defendants on the grid. The basic insight is that movement along the grid itself (either across rows or across columns) is nonlinear in sentence lengths (in both absolute magnitudes and percent terms). As a result, an additional point results in a different increase in the recommended sentence length depending on the other factors that are present. Because the distribution of factors is not random, factors like weapon use that appear to have equal weight in the formula developed by policymakers turn out to have very different weights in practice.",22 November 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Judgment by the Numbers: Converting Qualitative to Quantitative Judgments in Law, 222-238,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01227.x

In practice, the scope of these laws may be either more or less broad than the legislative intent. Using a large sample of defendants arrested for violent felonies and charged between 1990 and 2004, I do not find evidence that prosecutors or judges manipulate charges or sentences in a way that counteracts the spirit of TIS laws; instead, I find that the passage of TIS laws is associated with approximately 12- to 18-week longer sentences for people who are arrested for TIS-eligible crimes, but plead guilty to TIS-ineligible misdemeanors. This spillover effect of TIS laws into misdemeanor sanctions suggests that instead of being undone in the courtroom, TIS increases punishment for all violent offenders, not just those technically subject to the law.",22 November 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Judgment by the Numbers: Converting Qualitative to Quantitative Judgments in Law, 239-261,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01228.x
338,Predicting Civil Jury Verdicts: How Attorneys Use (and Misuse) a Second Opinion,"Jonas Jacobson, Jasmine Dobbs-Marsh, Varda Liberman, Julia A. Minson","When predicting potential jury verdicts, trial attorneys often seek second opinions from other attorneys. But how much weight do they give to these opinions, and how optimally do they use them? In a four-round estimation task developed by Liberman et al. (under review), pairs of law students and pairs of experienced trial attorneys estimated actual jury verdicts. When participants were given access to a partner's estimates, participants' accuracy improved in both groups. However, participants in both groups underweighted their partners' estimates relative to their own, with experienced attorneys giving less weight to their partners' opinions than did law students. In doing so, participants failed to reap the full benefits of statistical aggregation. In both groups, requiring partners to reach agreement on a joint estimate improved accuracy. This benefit was then largely retained when participants gave final individual estimates. In a further analysis, we randomly sampled estimates of various-sized groups. The accuracy of mean estimates substantially increased as group size increased, with the largest relative benefit coming from the first additional estimate. We discuss the implications of these findings for the legal profession and for the study of individual versus collective estimation.",22 November 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Judgment by the Numbers: Converting Qualitative to Quantitative Judgments in Law, 99-119,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01229.x
339,"Probable Cause, Probability, and Hindsight","Jeffrey J. Rachlinski, Chris Guthrie, Andrew J. Wistrich","When judges assess probable cause, they must do so either in foresight (when determining whether to issue a warrant) or in hindsight (when determining whether to allow the admission of evidence obtained without a search warrant). Although the legal standard for probable cause is the same, and the facts that might support cause are the same, judges who assess probable cause in hindsight invariably know whether a search produced incriminating evidence or not. Research on the hindsight bias suggests that judges will be unable to set aside this knowledge and judge probable cause as if they were working in foresight. In this article, we present three experiments in which we asked 900 state and federal judges to make judgments of probable cause either in foresight or in hindsight, in hypothetical cases. Surprisingly, we found that that judges make similar rulings on probable cause in foresight and in hindsight. We also found that hindsight appears to cloud judges' abilities to assess the likely outcome of the search, but hindsight does not influence their legal judgments.",22 November 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Judgment by the Numbers: Converting Qualitative to Quantitative Judgments in Law, 72-98,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01230.x
340,Trawling Genetic Databases: When a DNA Match is Just a Naked Statistic,"Nicholas Scurich, Richard S. John","Genetic databases are highly controversial. Significant controversy followed a report by the National Research Council (1996) concluding that a DNA match resulting from a database trawl is less probative than when only a single test is conducted. Legal scholars and statisticians have demonstrated why this conclusion is specious, but there is no empirical research examining what impact a trawl match has on jurors. The current experiment demonstrates that mock jurors are less likely to convict when a DNA match arises from a database trawl compared to a conventional confirmation case. Interestingly, however, the probability judgments of guilt did not differ between the cases. The Wells effect (Wells 1992) is consistent with this disjunction, where a trawl match is more likely to be viewed as naked statistical evidence that influences the perception of guilt but not guilty verdicts. A second study examined mock jurors' perceptions of the arguments advanced by the Bayesian and frequentist camps over the probative value of trawl matches. The frequentist argument led to fewer convictions, while the Bayesian argument increased the conviction rate, as expected. The Bayesian argument also attenuated the Wells effect. Implications for the introduction of trawl matches are considered in light of these findings.",22 November 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Judgment by the Numbers: Converting Qualitative to Quantitative Judgments in Law, 49-71,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01231.x

Rose, Beth Murphy, John Meixner","Experiments reveal anchoring as a powerful force, even when participants see the anchor as irrelevant. Here, we examine the reactions of real deliberating jurors to attorney damage requests and concessions in 31 cases involving 33 plaintiffs in which the jury awarded damages. Jurors were critical consumers of attorney suggestions. They reacted more negatively to, and were less influenced by, plaintiff ad damnums for pain and suffering than to damage requests in categories grounded in more objective evidence. Deliberations revealed that jurors often perceive plaintiff ad damnums not only as irrelevant, but also as outrageous, impressions reflected in their verdicts. These findings suggest that extreme plaintiff ad damnums, including those without grounding in quantitative evidence from trial, may not exert substantial undue influence.",22 November 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Judgment by the Numbers: Converting Qualitative to Quantitative Judgments in Law, 148-178,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01232.x

343,Is Pleading Really a Bargain?,David S. Abrams,"A criminal defendant's decision of whether to accept a plea bargain is one with serious consequences both for his or her immediate and long-term future. Conventional wisdom suggests that defendants are better served by entering into a plea bargain, to avoid what is known as the “trial penalty.” In this article I present evidence that this notion is likely mistaken. In OLS regressions using data from Cook County state courts, I find that a risk-neutral defendant seeking to minimize his or her expected sentence would do substantially better by rejecting a plea bargain. I also employ an IV approach to the question and, while the instrument is weak, the results are consistent with the OLS: defendants are better off going to trial.",22 November 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,Judgment by the Numbers: Converting Qualitative to Quantitative Judgments in Law, 200-221,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01234.x
344,When Do Generics Challenge Drug Patents?,"C. Scott Hemphill, Bhaven N. Sampat","The Hatch-Waxman Act regulates competition between brand-name and generic drugs in the United States. We examine a feature of the Act that has attracted great controversy but little systematic attention. “Paragraph IV” challenges are a mechanism for generic drug makers to challenge the patents of brand-name drug makers as a means to secure early market entry. We first present descriptive results that chart the rise of brand-name patent portfolios and Paragraph IV challenges. Over time, patenting has increased, measured by the number of patents per drug and the length of the nominal patent term. Meanwhile, the fraction of drugs subjected to patent challenges has increased. Drugs are also challenged sooner, relative to brand-name approval. Our econometric analyses of challenges over the past decade show that brand-name sales have a positive effect on the likelihood of generic challenge. The likelihood of challenge also varies with the nature of the patent portfolio. A drug with weaker patents faces a significantly higher likelihood of challenge, conditional on sales and other drug characteristics. That is not because the drug's patent protection is weaker overall; additional patents, even weak ones, generally strengthen a brand-name firm's ability to exclude. Rather, a weak patent, particularly if it expires later than the basic patents, disproportionately attracts a challenge to the pertinent drug. Overall, our results suggest these challenges serve a useful purpose by promoting scrutiny of weaker and late-expiring patents.",28 October 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 4", 613-649,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01235.x

Pritchard","We study the effect of campaign contributions to lead plaintiffs—“pay to play”—on the level of attorney fees in securities class actions. We find that state pension funds generally pay lower attorney fees when they serve as lead plaintiffs in securities class actions than do individual investors serving in that capacity, and larger funds negotiate for lower fees. This differential disappears, however, when we control for campaign contributions made to officials with influence over state pension funds. This effect is most pronounced when we focus on state pension funds that receive the largest campaign contributions and that associate repeatedly as lead plaintiff with a single plaintiff's attorney firm. Thus, pay to play appears to increase agency costs borne by shareholders in securities class actions, undermining one of Congress's principal goals in adopting the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.",28 October 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 4", 650-681,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01236.x
346,Fairness Ex Ante and Ex Post: Experimentally Testing Ex Post Judicial Intervention into Blockbuster Deals,"Christoph Engel, Michael Kurschilgen","The market for copyrights is characterized by a highly skewed distribution of profits: very few movies, books, and songs generate huge profits, whereas the great bulk barely manages to recover production cost. At the moment when the owner of intellectual property grants a license (ex ante), neither party knows the true value of the traded commodity. A seemingly odd provision from German copyright law, the so-called bestseller paragraph, stipulates that the seller of a license has a legally enforceable right to a bonus in case the work (ex post) turns out a blockbuster. We experimentally explore the effect of the provision on market prices, on the number of deals struck, and on perceived fairness. Our results show that the provision leads to lower prices for copyrights. More copyrights trade.

347,Lay Judgments of Judicial Decision Making,"Dan Simon, Nicholas Scurich","This study examined laypeople's evaluations of judicial decision making, specifically of the judicial decision-making process and the judiciary's legitimacy. Seven-hundred participants were presented with three judicial decisions, which were portrayed as following on the heels of solid and appropriate legal procedure. Each decision was accompanied by one of four types of reasoning. Participants were asked to evaluate the acceptability of the decisions, focusing on the manner in which they were made and to evaluate the legitimacy of the decisionmaker, all regardless of their outcomes. The study yielded four findings. First, laypeople's judgments were highly contingent on the outcome of the judges' decisions. Consistent with the theory of motivated reasoning, participants found the decisions highly acceptable when they agreed with the judges' decision, but deemed them relatively unacceptable when they disagreed with them. Second, participants were indifferent to the modes of reasoning offered by the judges when they agreed with the outcomes of the decisions, but were differentially sensitive to the modes of reasoning when the judges' decisions frustrated their preferred outcomes. Third, when participants were sensitive to the modes of reasoning, they gave higher ratings of acceptability to decisions that openly admitted to good reasons on both sides of the case as compared with decisions accompanied by reasons that supported one side of the case exclusively. Giving no reasons at all was found to be more acceptable than giving a single, curt reason. Fourth, the findings replicated the coherence effect.

Schulhofer","This study examines the effects of counterterrorism policing tactics on public cooperation among Muslim communities in London, U.K. The study reports results of a random-sample survey of 300 closed and fixed response telephone interviews conducted in Greater London's Muslim community in February and March 2010. It tests predictors of cooperation with police acting against terrorism. Specifically, the study provides a quantitative analysis of how perceptions of police efficacy, greater terrorism threat, and the perceived fairness of policing tactics (“procedural justice”) predict the willingness to cooperate voluntarily in law enforcement efforts against terrorism. Cooperation is defined to have two elements: a willingness to work with the police in anti-terror efforts, and the willingness to alert police upon becoming aware of a terror-related risk in a community. We find that among British Muslims, both measures of cooperation are better predicted by procedural justice concerns than by perceptions of police efficacy or judgments about the severity of the terrorism threat. Unlike previous studies of policing in the United States, however, we find no correlation between cooperation and judgments about the legitimacy of police; rather, procedural justice judgments influence cooperation directly.",28 October 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 4", 728-761,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01239.x
349,Safe Harbors from Fair-Cross-Section Challenges? The Practical Limitations of Measuring Representation in the Jury Pool,"Paula Hannaford-Agor, Nicole L. Waters","The U.S. Constitution guarantees criminal defendants the right to an impartial jury selected from a jury pool that reflects the demographic composition of the geographic community served by the court. Yet there is little consensus in case law from state and federal courts about the most appropriate method of measuring demographic representation or the degree of underrepresentation that would violate the fair-cross-section requirement. Although the U.S. Supreme Court recently addressed these issues for the first time since Duren v. Missouri, its opinion in Berghuis v. Smith did little to settle the questions. In the present article, the authors use demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau and information about jury operations in state courts from the National Center for State Courts to estimate the potential impact of competing proposals about how to measure demographic representation at different threshold levels of constitutional tolerance. Given the demographic composition of counties in the United States and the size of the jury pool in most courts, the authors find that a bright-line rule using either of the two most common measures of representation (absolute disparity and comparative disparity) would create “safe harbors” in which the courts in a majority of jurisdictions across the country would become effectively immune from fair-cross-section challenges.",28 October 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 4", 762-791,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01240.x

We use a series of event studies to measure the extent to which each court decision had an effect on the common share prices of Canadian forestry firms. These share price effects reflect investors' perception of the decisions' impact on forestry firms' contemporaneous access to resource stocks and uncertainty surrounding the security of their access into the future. A simulation model based on a resource industry's dynamic optimization problem links the stock access and uncertainty effects implied by our event studies to the commercial producers' economic fundamentals. Changes in the resource industry's simulated profits can be used in a general equilibrium framework to estimate the effect that the Court's decisions had on Canadian real GDP per capita growth during the 1970–2005 period. Our methodological approach allows us to estimate the aggregate, long-run macroeconomic effects that resulted from the Court's recognition of aboriginal rights, and also trace the channels through which these changes in the distribution of property rights influenced performance; we assess the relative importance of the current access and future uncertainty components of these changes.",28 October 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 4", 792-829,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01241.x
351,Political Ideology and Reactions to Crime Victims: Preferences for Restorative and Punitive Responses,"Dena M. Gromet, John M. Darley","We investigate the hypothesis that there are ideological differences in views about how crime victims can be restored. Across two studies, we found that liberal responses to victimization (Study 1) and crime (Study 2) are more reflective of a reparative mindset that directly addresses the needs and concerns of victims, whereas conservative responses are at least equally reflective of a punitive mindset that addresses victim harm through offender punishment. Furthermore, the salience of victim concerns, and whether people could carefully evaluate their judgments, affected the expression of these differing justice mindsets on people's satisfaction with the use of restoration and punishment in response to serious wrongdoing. When participants' cognitive resources were depleted, liberal satisfaction remained constant, whereas conservative satisfaction with the use of restoration decreased when victim concerns were salient. These results indicate that there are ideological differences in the adoption of both punitive and reparative justice mindsets, which can facilitate differing responses to victim concerns.",28 October 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 4", 830-855,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01242.x
352,Judicial Behavior on the Chilean Constitutional Tribunal,"Royce Carroll, Lydia Tiede","Research on judicial independence suggests that high courts can be designed to serve as external checks on political actors. However, independence from political influence does not necessarily imply incentives to use these powers. Chile's Constitutional Tribunal, while possessing significant powers, has been characterized as generally deferential to political actors. Using rulings from the Tribunal from 1990–2010, we examine whether reforms that increased the number of judges appointed by politicians and expanded the Tribunal's jurisdiction have contributed to a more assertive use of judicial review power. We find that the reforms have not produced an increased tendency to rule laws unconstitutional under abstract review. However, the new appointment structure has nevertheless increased the types of judges relatively more likely to assert this power. Specifically, after the reforms, judges appointed by elected actors were individually more likely to find laws unconstitutional than those appointed by the Supreme Court, especially on cases of concrete review of enacted laws. We also find that cases of abstract review brought by legislators have been especially associated with both unconstitutional rulings and individual judicial votes for unconstitutionality.",28 October 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 4", 856-877,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01243.x
353,The Price Effects of Event-Risk Protection: The Results from a Natural Experiment,"Karl Okamoto, David Pedersen, Natalie Pedersen","Prior studies conclude that bond prices reflect both an issuer's event risk and a bond's contractual protections from event risk. Therefore, it is assumed that the market requires a higher return for unprotected bonds than for comparable protected bonds. These prior studies, however, struggle with the problem of isolating the pricing effect by controlling for comparability. Issuers will differ from each other on a number of other attributes that could affect their bond prices. The issue of comparability eludes a simple modeling solution given the indefiniteness and multiplicity of variables that could cause the market to distinguish one issuer from another. Recent court decisions regarding the buyout of Bell Canada Enterprises provide a natural experiment for evaluating the pricing effect of event-risk protection that mitigates this comparability problem. Based on this experiment, we find support for the prior conclusions that an exogenous shift in event-risk protection is priced by the market.",28 October 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 4", 878-903,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01244.x

We provide the first empirical evidence that shareholders benefit from corporate misconduct. We find positive abnormal stock returns during the prediscovery period, which are only partially reversed during the postdiscovery period. Partitioning the results based on the relation between the alleged offending firm and damaged party, we find prediscovery outperformance is driven by third-party misconduct, and postdiscovery underperformance is driven by related-party misconduct. Although operating performance results are somewhat sensitive to the metric analyzed, overall they are consistent with the stock performance results. Taken as a whole, our findings provide evidence of a net benefit to shareholders from corporate misconduct when the damaged party is unrelated to the offending firm. Additionally, the disparity between postdiscovery operating performance based on the offending firm's relation with the offended party highlights the importance of reputational penalties.",03 August 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 3", 449-476,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01216.x

Using individual-level longitudinal data from 1981 to 1996 derived from the previously unexploited Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we examine the possible effect of the ADA on (1) annual weeks worked; (2) annual earnings; and (3) hourly wages for a sample of 7,120 unique male household heads between the ages of 21 and 65, as well as for a subset of 1,437 individuals appearing every year from 1981 to 1996. Our analysis of the larger sample suggests the ADA had a negative impact on the employment levels of disabled persons relative to nondisabled persons but no impact on relative earnings. However, our evaluation of the restricted sample raises questions about these findings. Using these data, we find little evidence of adverse effects on weeks worked but strong evidence of wage declines for the disabled, albeit declines beginning in 1986, well before the ADA's passage. These results therefore cast doubt on the adverse ADA-related impacts found in previous studies, particularly Acemoglu and Angrist (2001). The conflicting narratives that emerge from our analysis shed new light on, but also counsel caution in reaching final conclusions about, the impact of the ADA on employment outcomes for people with disabilities.",03 August 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 3", 477-503,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01217.x

An equally controversial claim is that male judges are better than female judges because the latter have benefited from affirmative action. These claims are susceptible to empirical analysis.

For many of our tests, we fail to find significant gender effects on judicial performance.

357,Fixing Lawyers' Fees Ex Ante: A Case Study in Policy and Empirical Legal Studies,"Paul Fenn, Neil Rickman","The relationship between legal fees and damages is fundamental to the way litigation is funded in most countries. In jurisdictions where fee shifting is the norm, the means by which courts regulate recoverable costs (i.e., the plaintiff's fees), and the extent to which they are proportional to damages, is of central importance. This article explores a recent case study from the United Kingdom involving the introduction of procedural rules designed to build an explicit and transparent degree of proportionality into the determination of legal costs. In October 2003, the Department of Constitutional Affairs in England and Wales announced the introduction of the “Fixed Recoverable Costs Scheme for Low Value Road Traffic Accident Claims.” This established a set of fixed costs that successful lawyers could recover from losing defendants in such cases. The Fixed Recoverable Costs Scheme was based closely on research undertaken by the authors for the Civil Justice Council and the current article describes the process that brought this about. In so doing, it provides an explicit example of empirical legal studies having a direct impact on policy. We were also asked to provide some basic evaluation of the scheme two years later and the article also shows how the scheme was operating, including some of the behavioral changes it apparently induced. We argue that some of these were predictable at the time the scheme was being designed and that the total experience allows us to consider ways the interaction between empirical legal studies and policy can be improved in the future.",03 August 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 3", 533-555,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01219.x

Two theoretical models were studied: the attitudinal model, according to which justices decide disputes consistent with their ideological positions; and the neo-institutional approach, according to which the roles and norms of the court as an institution affect the justices' decisions. Conclusions indicate that justices' attitudes in Israel have a very strong influence on their votes on the merits. Religiously observant justices were significantly more likely to support freedom of religion claims than nonobservant justices. At the same time, the neo-institutional claim that the law does matter is also supported by the findings.

Is LEI a system that is relevant only to the high-income groups that are not eligible for legal aid? Is it therefore a complement to legal aid? Or is LEI also of interest to lower-income groups, and can it serve as a substitute? Our analysis is based on data from the second wave of the Dutch Paths to Justice Survey held in 2009. We first study how the holdership of LEI policies is distributed among the population in general and among income classes in particular. We then discuss how the incidence of justiciable problems interrelates with the possession of LEI. Next, we study how the possession of LEI affects the responses to justiciable problems. Do people take action? Do they seek legal advice? From which sources? Finally, we take a look at the results. Comparing the respondents with and without LEI in various income classes, we try to answer the central question: Complement or substitute? We conclude that a shift from legal aid to LEI has some clear disadvantages for low-income citizens, but these may well be compensated for by some important advantages, brought to the fore by our empirical data.",03 August 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 3", 587-612,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01221.x

However, most of the research that debate refers to considers a relatively short timespan. This article reports an analysis of contestation and competitiveness in state supreme court elections for the entire post World War II period.

The central finding of the article is that outside the South there has been surprisingly little change, either in whether incumbents are challenged for reelection or in the competitiveness of the elections that are contested (looking separately at open-seat elections and elections involving incumbents). The analysis suggests that the apparent increase in competitiveness (taken to include the question of whether an incumbent is challenged), at least through 2009, reflects factors other than changes in the nature of campaigns and expenditures on state supreme court elections; specifically, those changes largely result from the end of the one-party South.",12 May 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 2", 237-259,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01208.x

Based on a sample of securities class action cases, we find that (1) some cases certified for class action status do not satisfy the conditions for even weak-form efficiency; (2) numerous opportunities exist for cost-effective investors (those who can trade quickly and at low cost) to profit by using simple momentum-based strategies; (3) including such investors as class members effectively subsidizes their strategies and overstates damages from reliance on market efficiency; (4) when such investors can profit by rejecting market efficiency, standard measures of damage overstate the fraud-related damage of other investors; and (5) because of endogeneity, the factors that commonly are relied on by the courts for determining market efficiency bear little or no relation to weak-form efficiency.",12 May 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 2", 260-303,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01209.x
362,Do Joint Parenting Laws Make Any Difference?,"Douglas W. Allen, Margaret Brinig","Using a unique data set on divorcing couples, we analyze the effects of a change in legal entitlement on the outcomes for divorcing couples. In particular, we analyze the 1997 change to custody provisions in the State of Oregon. Prior to 1997, Oregon assigned custody, based on the discretion of the court, in the best interests of the child. This was changed to a “presumption” of joint parenting, which manifests in the courts encouraging and imposing joint (or shared) custody in cases that otherwise would have had sole custody arrangements. We find that the law had several implications for divorce behavior: different custody outcomes (less sole custody to mothers, more sole custody to fathers), more mediation, longer times until the final divorce, and more acrimonious divorces (more abuse actions filed). We find no evidence that spouses attempted to bargain around the change of legal entitlement.",12 May 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 2", 304-324,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01210.x
363,Judge-Jury Difference in Punitive Damages Awards: Who Listens to the Supreme Court?,"Theodore Eisenberg, Michael Heise","We analyze thousands of trials from a substantial fraction of the nation's most populous counties as well as a smaller sample of less populous counties. Evidence from four major Civil Justice Survey data sets spanning more than a decade establishes that: (1) compensatory awards are strongly associated with punitive awards and (2) the punitive-compensatory relation has not materially changed over time. But (3) 2005 data suggest, for the first time, systematic differences between judges and juries in the punitive-compensatory relation. Despite claims that the Supreme Court's State Farm decision changed the punitive-compensatory relation, we present evidence that the 2005 shift is not attributable to the State Farm case or to other possibly relevant likely factors such as the relative flow of personal injury cases to judges and juries, inclusion of 110 small counties in the 2005 data, or changes in the 2005 data coding. The judge-jury difference more likely turns on unobserved factors driving the selection of cases for adjudication before judges and jurors.",12 May 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 2", 325-357,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01211.x
364,"Incorporation Law, Ownership Structure, and Firm Value: Evidence from Canada","Narjess Boubraki, Yves Bozec, Claude Laurin, Stéphane Rousseau","In this article, we reexamine the law and finance theory in the Canadian context, characterized by a dichotomy in the legal traditions that govern incorporation law across provinces. We specifically examine the relation between incorporation law, corporate ownership structure, and firm value, taking into account the endogeneity of ownership structure. Using a sample of 181 Canadian firms between 2002 and 2005, we show that firms from Quebec mostly choose to incorporate under the federal law (CBCA), perceived as more protective of shareholder rights, rather than under the provincial law (QCA). Our 2SLS regressions show that Quebec firms incorporated under the QCA tend to have more concentrated ownership and that ownership concentration is negatively related to firm value (Tobin's Q). These results are in line with the previous literature, which, in different pieces, has identified the positive relationship between less stringent legal environment and ownership concentration, as well as the negative relationship between ownership concentration and firm value. In this study, we formalize these relationships while taking into consideration the fact that firm value could also influence ownership concentration, as shown by Cho (1998). These results take on a particular importance as many researchers and organizations dedicated to the protection of investors, in Europe and in many countries around the world, have criticized the existence of ownership concentration and excess voting rights (wedge). These results thus reinforce the need for better corporate governance regulations to minimize the risks of minority shareholders expropriation.",12 May 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 2", 358-383,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01212.x
365,An Empirical Study of Court-Adjudicated Takings Compensation in New York City: 1990–2003,Yun-chien Chang,"No empirical study on court-adjudicated condemnation compensation has been done in the past 30 years. To fill in the empirical gap, I first collect condemnation compensation cases in New York City between 1990 and 2003, finding that the court usually rules in favor of condemnors. Additionally, I use hedonic regression models and about 7,500 sales to estimate the fair market value (FMV) of 27 condemned properties and compare the FMV with condemnors' offered value, condemnees' claimed value, and court awards, finding that all condemnees' claims are above FMV, while many condemnors' offers and court awards are above FMV; moreover, condemnors' claims come closer to FMV than condemnees' claims and court awards. The court usually favors condemnors because condemnors have better incentives to produce unbiased assessed value and condemnors' offered value actually is closer to FMV. Offers, claims, and awards are inaccurate because bias-prone appraisal techniques have been used to assess property value.",12 May 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 2", 384-412,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01213.x
366,Community Characteristics and Tort Law: The Importance of County Demographic Composition and Inequality to Tort Trial Outcomes,Issa Kohler-Hausmann,"Long-standing trial folklore holds that those counties with higher proportions of low-income and minority residents are places where tort plaintiffs are more likely to prevail in establishing the defendant's liability and to recover high damages. Although a handful of empirical legal studies have looked at this question, none have considered the possible role of a community effect of county income inequality. This article tests these propositions with hierarchical linear models of two types of tort trial outcomes—plaintiff success in establishing defendant liability and damage award—using a number of county-level predictors. The results show that no county-level variables measuring jury pool demographic composition or income inequality are associated with the odds of plaintiff success. However, both county poverty rate and income inequality are associated with increased levels of expected damages. The final section of this article offers a substantive theoretical discussion of why we might observe a relationship between community characteristics and tort trial outcomes.",12 May 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 2", 413-447,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2011.01214.x

368,An Empirical Study of Employment Arbitration: Case Outcomes and Processes,Alexander J. S. Colvin,"Using data from reports filed by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) pursuant to California Code requirements, this article examines outcomes of employment arbitration. The study analyzes 3,945 arbitration cases, of which 1,213 were decided by an award after a hearing, filed and reaching disposition between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2007. This includes all the employment arbitration cases administered nationally by the AAA during this time period that derived from employer-promulgated arbitration procedures. Key findings include: (1) the employee win rate among the cases was 21.4 percent, which is lower than employee win rates reported in employment litigation trials; (2) in cases won by employees, the median award amount was $36,500 and the mean was $109,858, both of which are substantially lower than award amounts reported in employment litigation; (3) mean time to disposition in arbitration was 284.4 days for cases that settled and 361.5 days for cases decided after a hearing, which is substantially shorter than times to disposition in litigation; (4) mean arbitration fees were $6,340 per case overall, $11,070 for cases disposed of by an award following a hearing, and in 97 percent of these cases the employer paid 100 percent of the arbitration fees beyond a small filing fee, pursuant to AAA procedures; (5) in 82.4 percent of the cases, the employees involved made less than $100,000 per year; and (6) the mean amount claimed was $844,814 and 75 percent of all claims were greater than $36,000. The study also analyzes whether there is a repeat player effect in employer arbitration. The results provide strong evidence of a repeat employer effect in which employee win rates and award amounts are significantly lower where the employer is involved in multiple arbitration cases, which could be explained by various advantages accruing to larger organizations with greater resources and expertise in dispute resolution procedures. The results also indicate the existence of a significant repeat-employer–arbitrator pairing effect in which employees on average have lower win rates and receive smaller damage awards where the same arbitrator is involved in more than one case with the same employer, a finding supporting some of the fairness criticisms directed at mandatory employment arbitration.",17 February 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 1", 1-23,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01200.x
369,Judicial Discretion and (Un)equal Access: A Systematic Study of Motions to Reduce Criminal Sentences in Rhode Island Superior Court (1998–2003),"Laura Braslow, Ross E. Cheit","Most jurisdictions allow criminal defendants to bring postconviction sentence reduction or modification motions, asking that the original sentencing judge reconsider legal sentences that they initially imposed. The ability to reconsider sentences could be an avenue for mercy, but the virtually unfettered discretion given to judges under these rules could also be an invitation to abuse, or a mechanism for back-door sentencing. This study seeks to empirically examine the practice of sentence reduction in the Rhode Island superior court system. Based on a universe sample of all cases where motions to reduce sentence were brought over a five-year period, this study utilizes multivariate models to isolate the determinants of motion outcomes. The study finds that a range of variables influence the outcome of sentence reduction motions, but regression analysis finds that, holding all else equal, the individual judges themselves are the most significant factor determining whether motions are granted or denied. This conclusion raises a number of questions relative to equal access to postconviction relief and equal treatment of criminal defendants in the context of judicial discretion.",17 February 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 1", 24-47,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01201.x

This thesis was tested with samples of felony defendants processed in Ohio courts before and after the implementation of sentencing guidelines. During the preguideline period only, African-American men accused of victimizing whites were less likely than other defendants to plead guilty in exchange for reduced charges and/or sentences, and African-American men incarcerated for violent crimes against whites received longer sentences than other incarcerated offenders. During the postguideline period only, by contrast, the odds of pleading guilty in exchange for reduced charges were actually higher for African-American men accused of victimizing whites. African-American male prison terms significantly declined relative to incarcerated whites from the preguideline to the postguideline period.

371,Is There a Chinese Common Law? An Empirical Study of the Bilingual Common-Law System of Hong Kong,Kwai Hang Ng,"This study presents results of the first empirical study of the role of Chinese in the newly established bilingual common-law system of Hong Kong. It considers whether Chinese performs the same role as English in the influential appellate court of Hong Kong. The study examines three facets of civil appeal. First, it asks if civil appeals conducted in Chinese exhibit the same level of legal representation as civil appeals in English. Second, it examines the likelihood of being professionally published among appeal judgments in the two languages. Third, it compares the financial stakes involved in Chinese and English appeals. The results suggest that despite what is stipulated in the Hong Kong Constitution, Chinese plays a marginal role in the higher courts of Hong Kong. There is no substantive development of a Chinese common law in Hong Kong. Instead, the availability of Chinese creates easier but problematic access to the legal system by the public in the form of pro se litigants. The findings also show that the reasons leading to the continued dominance of the English language in Hong Kong are global and social. As such, English is unlikely to be replaced in many postcolonial common-law systems in the world.",17 February 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 1", 118-146,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01203.x
372,An Empirical Examination of the Governance Choices of Income Trusts,"Anita I. Anand, Edward M. Iacobucci","Publicly traded trusts, known as income trusts, became very popular in recent years in Canada. Income trusts participate in a variety of industries, and do not simply fulfill specialized roles, like that of a special purpose entity in a securitization transaction. Because of the absence of mandatory statutory rules, these trusts have much greater freedom to choose particular governance terms than analogously situated corporations. In this article, we examine the individual declarations of trust (DOTs), which set out the governance regime for the firm, of 187 income trusts that listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange between 1996 and 2005. We compare private choices with respect to 25 mandatory terms found in the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA). Examining private choices of income trusts provides insight into the role of corporate law in supplementing/distorting private ordering in the corporate domain. On some dimensions, DOTs mimic the CBCA, but on other important dimensions, particularly remedial ones, they depart significantly from the CBCA. We also examine particular characteristics of the trust (e.g., its jurisdiction, size, industry, whether it listed as an IPO or by way of conversion from a corporation) in order to determine whether certain characteristics are associated with greater resemblance to the governance regime established in the CBCA. We find generally that certain jurisdictions (particularly Quebec) are statistically significantly and negatively correlated with CBCA provisions relative to others (Ontario), while year (2003 and beyond) is statistically significant and positively correlated with CBCA provisions. We find that industry, measured by type and one-digit SIC code, is statistically significant throughout the analysis. Firm size is also significant, though its relationship with CBCA adoption may be positive or negative depending on the particular provision in question.",17 February 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 1", 147-176,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01204.x
373,The Small Group Context: Designated District Court Judges in the U.S. Courts of Appeals,"Paul M. Collins, Jr., Wendy L. Martinek","Decision making in the U.S. courts of appeals occurs primarily in three-judge panels. A substantial number of cases are decided by panels that include a judge who is a district court judge serving temporarily on the appeals bench. This means that court of appeals decision making is often a function of small groups with temporary members. Here, we examine whether designated district court judges behave differently than their court of appeals colleagues when they cast their votes in cases they are deciding as members of three-judge appellate panels. In doing so, we suggest a profitable direction for theory building vis-à-vis judicial decision making. Our analysis of the ideological direction of the votes judges cast, as well as the variance in those votes, indicates that judges on three-judge panels are influenced by the preferences of their fellow panelists, and that designated district court judges, while no more variable than their court of appeals colleagues, are more susceptible to the influence of their peers than are regular members of the courts of appeals in a nontrivial number of cases.",17 February 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 1", 177-205,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01205.x
374,The Trial Penalty and Jury Sentencing: A Study of Air Force Courts-Martial,Patricia D. Breen,"The sentencing empirical literature generally supports the notion that most defendants plead guilty because judges impose more severe sentences for those who assert their Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Whether this trial penalty effect is present in jury sentencing jurisdictions has been rarely investigated. King and Noble (2004, 2005) presented evidence suggesting that in practice, jury sentencing assists prosecutors and judges in maintaining a trial penalty or plea discount system. The present study investigates whether a trial penalty exists in the military—a jury sentencing jurisdiction that offers jury sentencing after a guilty plea as well as a trial. Using Air Force court-martial data from 2005–2006, the study finds no trial penalty effect and that juries are less likely to impose severe types of punishment compared to judges. The study discusses implications for public policy, theory, and future research.",17 February 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 1", 206-235,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01206.x
375,Settlement at Policy Limits and the Duty to Settle: Evidence from Texas,"David A. Hyman, Bernard Black, Charles Silver","All liability insurance policies have coverage limits, and insurers usually control whether a case is settled or tried. If the insurer rejects a within-limits settlement offer, the insured bears the risk of an above-limits verdict. In response, virtually every state has imposed a “duty to settle” on insurers, which creates incentives for plaintiffs to make at-limits offers and for insurers to accept those offers when expected damages exceed limits. We study the association between the duty to settle, settlement at limits, claim duration, and defense costs using detailed data from Texas for 1988–2005 on closed, commercially insured personal injury claims. We focus principally on medical malpractice suits against physicians, but find consistent evidence for other types of cases. We find strong evidence that the duty to settle affects settlement dynamics. Essentially, all physician-defendant cases that settle at limits are preceded by an at-limits demand. Roughly 20 percent of physician-defendant cases settle at 90–100 percent of policy limits (broad at-limits) and 13 percent settle exactly at limits (exact at-limits). Broad- and exact-at-limits cases close about five months faster than similar “below-limits” cases—a roughly 20 percent shorter time from suit to settlement, controlling for payout and type of harm. Broad- and exact-at-limits cases also have substantially lower defense costs, controlling for case duration and complexity. More broadly, as the payout/limits ratio approaches 1 from below, duration declines (controlling for payout) and defense costs decline (controlling for payout and duration). Payouts above limits are uncommon; when they occur, insurers are the primary payers. Policy limits alone cannot explain these results; most likely they reflect a combination of policy limits and the duty to settle.",17 February 2011,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 8, Issue 1", 48-84,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01207.x
376,"Pot as Pretext: Marijuana, Race, and the New Disorder in New York City Street Policing","Amanda Geller, Jeffrey Fagan","Although possession of small quantities of marijuana has been decriminalized in New York State since the late 1970s, arrests for marijuana possession in New York City have increased more than tenfold since the mid-1990s, and remain high more than 10 years later. This rise has been a notable component of the city's “Order Maintenance Policing” strategy, designed to aggressively target low-level offenses, usually through street interdictions known as “stop, question, and frisk” activity. We analyze data on 2.2 million stops and arrests carried out from 2004 to 2008, and identify significant racial disparities in the implementation of marijuana enforcement. These disparities, present in both stops and arrests, are robust to controls for social structure, local crime conditions, and stop levels more broadly. The racial imbalance in marijuana enforcement in black neighborhoods suggests a “doubling down” of street-level policing in places already subject to heightened scrutiny in the search for weapons, a link suggesting that the policing of marijuana may be a pretext in the search for guns. Despite these ties, however, we show no significant relationship between marijuana enforcement activity and the likelihood of seizing firearms or other weapons. We also show that a large proportion of marijuana enforcement lacks constitutional justification under either federal or New York law. Marijuana stops are more prevalent in precincts where “other” and “high-crime area” justifications are more likely to be reported, two factors that are constitutionally insufficient to justify a street stop. The racial skew, questionable constitutionality, and limited efficiency of marijuana enforcement in detecting serious crimes suggest that nonwhite New Yorkers bear a racial tax from contemporary policing strategy, a social cost not offset by any substantial observed benefits to public safety.",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 591-633,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01190.x
377,A Bayesian Hierarchical Regression Approach to Clustered and Longitudinal Data in Empirical Legal Studies,"William Anderson, Martin T. Wells","The various forms of regression are a dominant feature of modern data analysis. This is hardly surprising since the basic premises of regression are well understood in many different areas of research, and basic regression analysis is a standard component in many statistical software packages. However, researchers do not have to venture very far in their applications of regression analysis to run into trouble from a computational and modeling point of view. This is especially apparent when modeling longitudinal or repeated measures data using classical regression. We introduce a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to clustered and longitudinal data. These hierarchical models overcome many of the limitations of classical regression and are well suited to handle longitudinal data. The intuitive concepts of hierarchical models are introduced via the Donohue and Levitt (DL) abortion-crime data set, using the statistical software package R. We show that when properly modeled, there is no empirical relationship between abortion and crime using the DL data set.",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 634-663,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01191.x
378,"Judicial Setbacks, Material Gains: Terror Litigation at the Israeli High Court of Justice","Menachem Hofnung, Keren Weinshall Margel","Recent research indicates that even in countries with strong judicial review, supreme courts have proved reluctant to oppose restrictions on civil liberties in times of war, or in crises that resemble war-like emergencies. Accordingly, most research conducted on the Israeli High Court of Justice argues that despite using the rhetoric of human rights, the HCJ rarely intervenes in security-based decisions targeted to prevent terrorist activity. Our research, based on an empirical sample of cases litigated at the HCJ in 2000–2008, argues that the picture is more complex, and that in fact the Israeli court does play a significant role in reducing human rights violations. Although in most cases the HCJ does not overtly intervene in the decisions of the security authorities, we show that the court's decisions on terror contain an implicit, yet no less important, facet in preventing numerous harmful decisions. We further test the relationship between the overt and latent nature of the HCJ's power, and show how different political and security conditions, such as the public mood or the occurrence of deadly terror attacks, affect justices' decisions to reject a petition, openly accept it, or intervene more latently in the security authorities' policies.",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 664-692,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01192.x
379,Managerial Entrenchment and Capital Structure: New Evidence,"Kose John, Lubomir Litov","Prior research has often taken the view that entrenched managers tend to avoid debt. Contrary to this view, we find that firms with entrenched managers, as measured by the Gompers et al. (2003) governance index, use more debt finance and have higher leverage ratios. To address the potential endogeneity of the governance index, we use instrumental variables analysis and the exogenous shock to corporate governance generated by the adoption of state anti-takeover laws. We find that firms incorporated in states that adopt restrictive anti-takeover laws increase the debt component of their external financing. Our evidence is consistent with entrenched managers receiving better access to debt markets (better credit ratings) and better financing terms (perhaps in response to the conservative investment policy that they pursue).",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 693-742,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01193.x
380,Relational Governance and Contract Damages: Evidence from Franchising,Adam B. Badawi,"A substantial body of theoretical, qualitative, and experimental research has investigated whether reliance on legal threats “crowds out” informal, norm-based ways of regulating behavior or, instead, whether the ability to enforce law formally enhances the ability of private parties to use these informal approaches. There has, however, been little quantitative, real-world work that looks into this question. This article begins this process through a study of how franchisors regulate the incentives that their franchisees have to cut corners on the brand's quality and uniformity standards. One solution to this problem is to threaten to pursue a breach of contract action for violation of these standards, which allows the franchisor to obtain a damage award against a franchisee. Alternatively, a franchisor can rely on more informal means, such as awarding an extra franchise outlet to those franchisees who behave well. There is a tradeoff between these two mechanisms; the informal rewards are costly to provide, but easy to enforce, while contractual threats are cheap, but their enforcement is expensive. Moreover, the literature on relational governance suggests that the use of formal legal threats may undermine an agent's willingness to abide by reciprocation norms along noncontractible dimensions. These theories suggest that formal and informal mechanisms will act as substitutes and this study, which uses a newly collected data set of franchise agreements, provides strong evidence for that assertion. The analytical insight that permits this inference is the presence of liquidated damages provisions as an indicator of the willingness to use formal law. Courts have shown hostility to the use of the default rule of expectation damages, but they will enforce liquidated damages terms, which means that these provisions are a credible threat to use formal legal sanctions. This study finds that a limited number of franchisors use these terms and that their presence correlates negatively and significantly with variables that are associated with informal, nonlegal means of incentivizing franchisees.",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 743-785,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01194.x
381,An Empirical Investigation of Settlement and Litigation—The Case of Taiwanese Labor Disputes,"Kuo-Chang Huang, Kong-Pin Chen, Chang-Ching Lin","Using newly collected data on labor disputes in Taiwan, we study the characteristics of cases settled out of court, cases dropped after settlement fails, and cases actually brought to court. We find that the size of the stakes plays a crucial role in routing between settlement and litigation. In particular, our study shows that increasing stakes decreases the probability of settlement, decreases the percent of the claim recovered in settlement, and increases the probability of litigation after settlement fails. Moreover, while the plaintiff's credibility of threatening a lawsuit is an important factor, its absence is not so important as to undermine the pattern that an increase in the stakes would decrease the likelihood of settlement. Our study also reveals that the mediation mechanism performs the function of allowing workers with small claims to obtain effective recovery, which would be impossible if those workers had to resort to litigation. This result also suggests that the traditional game-theoretic models are inadequate in explaining the litigants' behavior in settlement of small claims. Finally, we find that the workers' risk aversion might cause the percent of the claim recovered in settlement to drop as the amount of their initial claim increases.",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 786-810,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01195.x
382,An Empirical Study of Class Action Settlements and Their Fee Awards,Brian T. Fitzpatrick,"This article is a comprehensive empirical study of class action settlements in federal court. Although there have been prior empirical studies of federal class action settlements, these studies have either been confined to securities cases or have been based on samples of cases that were not intended to be representative of the whole (such as those settlements approved in published opinions). By contrast, in this article, I attempt to study every federal class action settlement from the years 2006 and 2007. As far as I am aware, this study is the first attempt to collect a complete set of federal class action settlements for any given year. I find that district court judges approved 688 class action settlements over this two-year period, involving nearly $33 billion. Of this $33 billion, roughly $5 billion was awarded to class action lawyers, or about 15 percent of the total. Most judges chose to award fees by using the highly discretionary percentage-of-the-settlement method, and the fees awarded according to this method varied over a broad range, with a mean and median around 25 percent. Fee percentages were strongly and inversely associated with the size of the settlement. The age of the case at settlement was positively associated with fee percentages. There was some variation in fee percentages depending on the subject matter of the litigation and the geographic circuit in which the district court was located, with lower percentages in securities cases and in settlements from the Second and Ninth Circuits. There was no evidence that fee percentages were associated with whether the class action was certified as a settlement class or with the political affiliation of the judge who made the award.",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 811-846,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01196.x
383,Punishment Despite Reasonable Doubt—A Public Goods Experiment with Sanctions Under Uncertainty,"Kristoffel Grechenig, Andreas Nicklisch, Christian Thöni","Under a great variety of legally relevant circumstances, people have to decide whether or not to cooperate when they face an incentive to defect. The law sometimes provides people with sanctioning mechanisms to enforce pro-social behavior. Experimental evidence on voluntary public goods provision shows that the option to punish others substantially improves cooperation, even if punishment is costly. However, these studies focus on situations where there is no uncertainty about the behavior of others. We investigate sanctions in a world with “reasonable doubt” about the contributions of others. Interestingly, people reveal a high willingness to punish even if their information about cooperation rates is highly inaccurate. If there is some nontrivial degree of noise, punishment (1) cannot establish cooperation high and (2) reduces welfare even below the level of a setting without punishment. Our findings suggest that sufficient information accuracy about others' behavior is crucial for the efficiency of sanction mechanisms. If a situation is characterized by low information accuracy, precluding sanctions, for example, through high standards of proof, is likely to be optimal.",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 847-867,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01197.x
384,Making Talk Cheap (and Problems Easy): How Legal and Political Institutions Can Facilitate Consensus,"Cheryl Boudreau, Mathew D. McCubbins, Daniel B. Rodriguez, Nicholas Weller","In many legal, political, and social settings, people must reach a consensus before particular outcomes can be achieved and failing to reach a consensus may be costly. In this article, we present a theory and conduct experiments that take into account the costs associated with communicating, as well as the difficulty of the decisions that groups make. We find that when there is even a small cost (relative to the potential benefit) associated with sending information to others and/or listening, groups are much less likely to reach a consensus, primarily because they are less willing to communicate with one another. We also find that difficult problems significantly reduce group members’ willingness to communicate with one another and, therefore, hinder their ability to reach a consensus.",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 868-885,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01198.x

Measuring the Myth of Colorblindness,"Jerry Kang, Nilanjana Dasgupta, Kumar Yogeeswaran, Gary Blasi","This study examined whether explicit and implicit biases in favor of Whites and against Asian Americans would alter evaluation of a litigator's deposition. We found evidence of both explicit bias as measured by self-reports, and implicit bias as measured by two Implicit Association Tests. In particular, explicit stereotypes that the ideal litigator was White predicted worse evaluation of the Asian American litigator (out group derogation); by contrast, implicit stereotypes predicted preferential evaluation of the White litigator (in group favoritism). In sum, participants were not colorblind, at least implicitly, toward even a “model minority,” and these biases produced racial discrimination. This study provides further evidence of the predictive and ecological validity of the Implicit Association Test in a legal domain.",18 November 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 4", 886-915,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01199.x

We provide new evidence on ethnic biases in judicial behavior by examining the decisions of Arab and Jewish judges in first bail hearings of Arab and Jewish suspects in Israeli courts. Our setting avoids the potential bias from unobservable case characteristics by exploiting the random assignment of judges to cases during weekends and by focusing on the difference in ethnic disparity between Arab and Jewish judges. The study concentrates on the early-stage decisions in the judicial criminal process, controlling for the state's position and excluding agreements, thereby allowing us to distinguish judicial bias from other sources of ethnic disparities. We find systematic evidence of in-group (same ethnic group) bias in detention decisions. However, in cases where the decision is to detain, no ethnic bias was found in the length of the detention. Possible interpretations and implications of these findings are discussed.",22 July 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 3", 403-428,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01183.x
387,Worthless Warnings? Testing the Effectiveness of Disclaimers in Mutual Fund Advertisements,"Molly Mercer, Alan R. Palmiter, Ahmed E. Taha","More than $11 trillion is invested in mutual funds in the United States. Mutual fund investors flock to funds with high past returns, despite there being little, if any, relationship between high past returns and high future returns. Because fund management fees are based on the amount of assets invested in their funds, however, fund companies regularly advertise the returns of their high-performing funds. The SEC requires these advertisements to contain a disclaimer warning that past returns do not guarantee future returns and that investors could lose money in the funds. This article presents the results of an experiment that finds that this SEC-mandated disclaimer is completely ineffective. The disclaimer neither reduces investors' propensity to invest in advertised funds nor diminishes their expectations regarding the funds' future returns. The experiment also suggests, however, that a stronger disclaimer—one that informs investors that high fund returns generally do not persist—would be much more effective.",22 July 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 3", 429-459,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01184.x

Rasmusen","Using micro-level tax data on attorney incomes in 2004 (when the law was changed to make it confidential), we analyze the industrial organization of the Japanese bar. These data suggest two sources of high income: an idiosyncratic return to talent in Tokyo and a compensating differential for the lack of amenities in the provinces. The most able would-be lawyers (those with the highest opportunity costs) pass the bar-exam equivalent on one of their first tries or abandon the effort and pursue careers outside of law. If they pass, they opt for careers in Tokyo that involve complex litigation and business transactions. This work places a premium on their talent, and from it they earn appropriately high incomes. The less talented face lower opportunity costs and opt to spend many years studying for the exam. If they do eventually pass, they apparently choose between a relatively low-income career in Tokyo and a provincial career paying a compensating differential.",22 July 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 3", 460-489,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01185.x

390,Community Perceptions of Theft Seriousness: A Challenge to Model Penal Code and English Theft Act Consolidation,"Stuart P. Green, Matthew B. Kugler","In the middle of the 20th century, criminal law reformers helped pass laws that consolidated previously distinct common-law offenses such as larceny, embezzlement, false pretenses, extortion, blackmail, and receiving stolen property into a unified offense of theft, imposing uniform punishments for a diversity of methods of stealing and a diversity of types of property that could be stolen. The result was a “consolidated” scheme of theft, with a single, broad definition of property (typically, “anything of value”) and a single scheme of grading (based, roughly, on the value of the thing stolen). In this study, participants were given two sets of scenarios—one involving variations in the means by which a theft was committed, the other involving variations in the type of property stolen—and asked to rate these thefts in terms of blameworthiness and punishment deserved. They drew sharp distinctions across both means of theft and type of property, not adopting a consolidated view. Under the principle of fair labeling—the idea that criminal law offenses should be divided and labeled so as to represent widely felt views about the nature and magnitude of law breaking—such data provide the basis for a significant challenge to modern theft law.",22 July 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 3", 511-537,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01187.x

(2006) utilized the random assignment of judges to cases in the U.S. Courts of Appeals to estimate the effect of partisanship on these judges without the possibility of bias from unobserved heterogeneity. This article critiques and improves their study by controlling for changes in circuit composition over time, including cases in issue areas that Sunstein et al. omitted, and omitting cases from circuits where judges were not randomly assigned. I find that Sunstein et al. slightly underestimated the effect of partisanship in the courts of appeals, failed to find evidence of partisan effects for issue areas in which judges are affected by partisanship, mistakenly found evidence of partisan effects for issue areas in which judges are not affected by partisanship, and underestimated the degree to which partisanship varies between circuits.

Nelson, Ryon Lancaster","This article analyzes the outcomes of employment discrimination lawsuits filed in federal court from 1988 to 2003. It goes beyond previous research by examining case filings rather than published opinions and by treating case outcome as a sequential variable. Our analysis is informed by four theoretical models: formal legal, rational action/economic, legal mobilization, and critical realist. We employ a discrete-time event-history model with random effects to estimate whether a case will end at a particular stage. We find that employment discrimination litigation consists overwhelmingly of individual cases, a majority of which end in a small settlement. The outcomes of cases are difficult to predict at the outset of litigation. Legal representation and collective legal mobilization have powerful effects on outcome, but collective legal mobilization is rare. These results are most consistent with the critical realist perspective. Our analysis suggests that employment discrimination litigation maintains law's jurisdiction over claims of workplace discrimination while not providing a significant remedy or an authoritative resolution in most cases.",10 May 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 2", 175-201,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01175.x

Kastellec,"A key question in the quantitative study of legal rules and judicial decision making is the structure of the relationship between case facts and case outcomes. Legal doctrine and legal rules are general attempts to define this relationship. This article summarizes and utilizes a statistical method relatively unexplored in political science and legal scholarship—classification trees—that offers a flexible way to study legal doctrine. I argue that this method, while not replacing traditional statistical tools for studying judicial decisions, can better capture many aspects of the relationship between case facts and case outcomes. To illustrate the method's advantages, I conduct classification tree analyses of search and seizure cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court and confession cases decided by the courts of appeals. These analyses illustrate the ability of classification trees to increase our understanding of legal rules and legal doctrine.",10 May 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 2", 202-230,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01176.x

In collaboration with a trial research firm, we recruited 461 jury-eligible men and women who matched the demographic characteristics of jury pools in several states. Surrogate jurors responded to questions and statements in five areas: likely rates of false confessions for different crimes, the ability to discern true from false confessions, beliefs about false confessions, beliefs about permissible interrogation tactics, and beliefs about expert testimony on police interrogations. Results indicated that jurors believed that police interrogators are better than ordinary people at identifying lies and that this ability improves with experience. Jurors believed that they would be able to differentiate a true confession from a false confession by watching a videotape, but were less confident about making such a differentiation from an audio recording. A large majority of the sample reported that it would be helpful to hear expert testimony about interrogation techniques and reasons why a defendant might falsely confess to a crime. There were no significant gender differences. Compared to whites, nonwhite jurors had significantly less confidence in the abilities of the police and gave significantly higher estimates of false confession rates. Results are discussed in light of prior research and implications for jury decision making and expert testimony.",10 May 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 2", 231-247,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01177.x
396,Attorney Fees and Expenses in Class Action Settlements: 1993–2008,"Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey P. Miller","We report on a comprehensive database of 18 years of available opinions (1993–2008, inclusive) on settlements in class action and shareholder derivative cases in state and federal courts. An earlier study, covering 1993–2002, revealed a remarkable relationship between attorney fees and class recovery size: regardless of the methodology for calculating fees ostensibly employed by the courts, the class recovery size was the overwhelmingly important determinant of the fee. The present study, which nearly doubles the number of cases in the database, confirms that relationship. Fees display the same relationship to class recoveries in both data sets and neither fees nor recoveries materially increased over time. Although the size of the class recovery dwarfs other influences, significant associations exist between the fee amount and both the fee method used and the riskiness of the case. We found no robust evidence of significant differences between federal and state courts. The strong association between fee and class recovery persists in cases with recoveries of $100 million or more, as do the significant associations between fee level and fee method and risk. Fees were not significantly affected by the existence of a settlement class, the presence of objectors, or opt outs from the class. Courts granted the requested fee in over 70 percent of the cases, with the Second Circuit granting the requested amount least often. In cases denying the requested fee, the mean fee was 68 percent of the requested amount. Fees and costs exhibit scale effects with the percent of each decreasing as the class recovery amount increased. Costs are strongly associated with hours expended on the case.",10 May 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 2", 248-281,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01178.x

It uses indicators of pro-worker court awards and court efficiency as well as amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) at the level of Indian states. The state-level IDA amendments are classified in relation to their pro-worker stance and ability to enforce existing legislation. The main finding is that the relationship between formal employment in both the industrial and service sectors and the judicial indicators is weak. Results are not robust to model specification. Thus, the evidence is neither robust nor strong enough to confirm the much claimed negative relationship between pro-worker judicial change and the degree of formal work in the entire service or industrial sectors.",10 May 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 2", 282-321,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01179.x
398,The Gendered Dimensions of Inheritance: Empirical Food for Legal Thought,Daphna Hacker,"Inheritance is an extremely significant personal, familial, social, and legal phenomenon. Due to the significance of inheritance in wealth distribution and family relations, it is essential to uncover and discuss its gendered dimensions, which have benefited from surprisingly little empirical or legal attention. This article provides an updated state-of-the-art review of the limited available empirical data on women as legators and on women as heirs in different parts of the world. The review is based on 23 studies, including the original results from a study the author conducted on inheritance in Israel, which illuminates the reach of insights that can be drawn from an inheritance study that focuses on gender. The review shows a sharp dichotomy between the ongoing discrimination women experience in non-Western societies in relation to inheritance and the social reality in the West, in which inheritance is a rare economic space in which women enjoy privilege, power, and control. Although egalitarian inheritance laws have had a dramatic impact on women's representation in intestacy and their participation in will writing in the West, the data demonstrate that even in this part of the world, cultural patriarchal practices persist and limit women's inheritance rights and, accordingly, point to the importance of creating legal mechanisms that can counterbalance these practices. Moreover, the available data indicate the value of freedom of testation for women and the importance of ceasing to regard care as cause for suspicion in inheritance law, and instead viewing it as a practice deserving of reward. Finally, the article identifies the areas in which further research on gender and inheritance is warranted, hopefully spurring greater interest and developments in the field.",10 May 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 2", 322-354,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01180.x

Hartmann","This research studies the impact of changes to judicial discretion on criminal sentencing outcomes. The 2003 Feeney Amendment restricted federal judges' ability to impose sentences outside of the Sentencing Guidelines and required appellate courts to review downward departures. Using data on all federal sentences between 1999 and 2004, we show that the amendment reduced downward departures by 5 percent. Controlling for characteristics of the crime and the offender, we find that the Amendment increased average prison sentences by about two months.

400,O'Connell Early Settlement Offers: Toward Realistic Numbers and Two-Sided Offers,"Bernard Black, David A. Hyman, Charles Silver","In a prior article in this journal, we estimated the effect of an “O'Connell” early settlement offer program on payouts in medical malpractice litigation. Using Texas data and a base set of assumptions, we predicted that early offers would result in a 16 percent (20 percent) decline in payouts in currently tried (settled) cases. The overall decline came almost entirely from a sharp drop in payouts in cases with small economic damages. We compared our results with the estimate by Hersch, O'Connell, and Viscusi (2007) (HOV) of a 70 percent reduction in payouts, reconciled the two estimates, and explained why HOV's estimate reflected the compound effects of a series of unreasonable assumptions. In a reply in this journal, Hersch, O'Connell, and Viscusi (2010) (HOV-2) complain that we misunderstand both the early offer proposal and their analysis. Remarkably, they do not dispute our estimates, given our assumptions. In this rebuttal, we defend our assumptions and provide an alternate analysis of settled cases based on insurer allocations, which also produces an estimated 20 percent payout decline. We also develop further our proposal for two-sided early offers. This proposal would reduce the predicted payout decline by about 2 percent in both tried and settled cases. We explain in greater detail the problems with HOV's analysis. If we correct an error they made in understanding the Texas data set, and leave their other assumptions unchanged, their payout decline estimate drops to 30 percent, not far from ours.",10 May 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 2", 379-401,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01182.x

Singapore had an execution rate close to one per million per year until an explosive 20-fold increase in 1994–1995 and 1996 to a level that we show was probably the highest in the world. Then, over the next 11 years, Singapore executions dropped by about 95 percent. Hong Kong, by contrast, had no executions at all during the last generation and abolished capital punishment in 1993. Homicide levels and trends are remarkably similar in these two cities over the 35 years after 1973, with neither the surge in Singapore executions nor the more recent steep drop producing any differential impact. By comparing two closely matched places with huge contrasts in actual execution but no differences in homicide trends, we have generated a unique test of the exuberant claims of deterrence that have been produced over the past decade in the United States.",19 February 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 1", 1-29,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01168.x

Compensation tracked whether the harm actually occurred, though when harm has not yet occurred but might, participants prefer an escrow-like solution in which money will be available to the victim only if the risk matures into actual harm. Retributive sanctions (punitive damages, fines, prison terms) were largely unaffected by whether the harm materialized but were instead sensitive to whether the wrongdoer exhibited negligent or reckless conduct. Thus, subjects clearly differentiated between the retributive nature of punitive sanctions and the compensatory nature of restorative damages. Finally, subjects often assigned liability to the actor even when the risk-causing actions were not negligent—and in this way preferred a strict liability stance more than does the current legal doctrine.",19 February 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 1", 30-63,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01169.x
403,Why ADR Programs Aren't More Appealing: An Empirical Perspective,Michael Heise,"Standard law and economic theory suggests that litigating parties seeking to maximize welfare will participate in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) programs if they generate a surplus. ADR programs claim to generate social surplus partly through promoting settlements and reducing case disposition time. Although most associate ADR programs with trial courts, a relatively recent trend involves appellate court use of ADR programs. The emergence of court-annexed ADR programs raises a question. Specifically, if ADR programs achieve their goals of promoting settlements and reducing disposition time, why do some courts find it necessary to impose ADR participation? Attention to ADR's ability to achieve its goals provides one clue. Most empirical assessments of ADR program efficacy have been mixed. This study exploits a uniquely comprehensive database of state civil court trials and appeals and tests hypotheses germane to questions about whether court-annexed appellate ADR programs stimulate settlement and reduce disposition time. Using data from 46 large counties consisting of 8,038 trials that generated 965 filed appeals, with 166 appeals participating in ADR programs, findings from this study provide mixed support for ADR programs. Specifically, results from this study indicate that participation in an ADR program correlates with an increased likelihood of settlement but not with reduced disposition time. ADR program mixed efficacy diminishes its appeal to litigants. Institutional interests help explain why appellate courts impose ADR participation notwithstanding mixed results on ADR efficacy.",19 February 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 1", 64-96,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01170.x

407,Reply to “The Effects of ‘Early Offers’ in Medical Malpractice Cases: Evidence from Texas”,"Joni Hersch, Jeffrey O'Connell, W. Kip Viscusi","This article is a reply to the critique by Black, Hyman, and Silver (BHS) of our 2007 Journal of Legal Studies article, “An Empirical Assessment of Early Offer Reform for Medical Malpractice.” The early offer reform gives insurers the option of making an early offer that will expedite payment of claimants' economic losses and reasonable attorney fees. Using data on closed medical malpractice claims from the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI), our 2007 article estimates the financial impact of this proposal by comparing the expected payments to claimants under the early offer reform to the payments tinder current tort rules. A central component of our calculation of expected payments is unique information on insurers' reserves associated with the claim; actual payments are reported in the TDI data for all litigated and settled cases involving payments of at least $10,000. The BHS article misrepresents fundamental aspects of our empirical analysis, including the following. BHS set out to correct our purported “false assumption” that all claims have a 1.0 probability of success, which is a problem that arises because BHS omit the probability of claimant success from the formula that is presented in our paper. BHS's error is compounded as their discussion of our paper fails to recognize that our use of reserve amounts in the analysis incorporates the insurers’ estimates of the likelihood of claimant success, Indeed, they neither acknowledge our use of the insurer reserve data, nor do they use the insurer reserve information in their paper. BHS claim incorrectly that our analysis does not discount deferred payments whereas in fact it does. Our early offer analysis uses data for both litigated and settled claims, avoiding the selection bias and measurement error problems associated with BHS's extrapolation from the 2 percent of paid claims that are litigated to the universe of all settled and litigated claims. The BHS article also reflects a misunderstanding of the operation of the early offer reform.",19 February 2010,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 7, Issue 1", 164-173,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01174.x
408,"U.S. Chamber of Commerce Liability Survey: Inaccurate, Unfair, and Bad for Business",Theodore Eisenberg,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce uses its Survey of State Liability to criticize judiciaries and seek legal change but no detailed evaluation of the survey's quality exists. This article presents evidence that the survey is substantively inaccurate and methodologically flawed. It incorrectly characterizes state law; respondents provide less than 10 percent correct answers for objectively verifiable responses. It is internally inconsistent; a state threatened with judicial hellhole status ranked first in the survey while venues not on the list ranked lower. The absence of correlation between survey rankings and observable activity suggests that other factors drive the rankings. Two factors may help explain them. First, persistent low ranking of Gulf Coast states indicates that corporate counsel cannot shed hostility to states that were prominent in asbestos and tobacco litigation, notwithstanding changes in state laws. Second, low rankings of populous states suggest respondents fail to distinguish between rates of events and the absolute number of events. Adverse events in large states may occur more often but not necessarily at higher rates than in small states. The Chamber's uses of the survey fail to account for the sample design, fail to account for the same respondent rating multiple states, fail to account for industry effects, and fail to distinguish among respondents based on their knowledge of a state. The survey may discourage investment in the United States. and corporate risk managers' views suggest that the survey promotes corporate behavior that needlessly endangers the public.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 969-1002,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01155.x
409,Do Noneconomic Damages Caps and Attorney Fee Limits Reduce Access to Justice for Victims of Medical Negligence?,"Steven Garber, Michael D. Greenberg, Hilary Rhodes, Xiaohui Zhuo, John L. Adams","We analyze effects of noneconomic damages caps and attorney fee limits (AFLs) on the ability of people injured by negligent physicians to retain qualified lawyers to represent them. We employ survey data from 965 plaintiffs' attorneys who reported likelihoods of accepting hypothetical meritorious cases described by scenarios. We estimate how willingness to accept such cases increases with the expected hourly fees associated with them, and the estimates suggest substantial effects and plausible tradeoffs. We conclude that caps and AFLs make it harder to retain counsel in various circumstances, and we present policy simulations elucidating how several factors combine to determine these effects.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 637-686,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01156.x
410,Private Enforcement of Corporate Law: An Empirical Comparison of the United Kingdom and the United States,"John Armour, Bernard Black, Brian Cheffins, Richard Nolan","It is often assumed that strong securities markets require good legal protection of minority shareholders. This implies both “good” law—principally, corporate and securities law—and enforcement, yet there has been little empirical analysis of enforcement. We study private enforcement of corporate law in two common-law jurisdictions with highly developed stock markets, the United Kingdom and the United States, examining how often directors of publicly traded companies are sued, and the nature and outcomes of those suits. We find, based a comprehensive search for filings over 2004–2006, that lawsuits against directors of public companies alleging breach of duty are nearly nonexistent in the United Kingdom. The United States is more litigious, but we still find, based on a nationwide search of court decisions between 2000–2007, that only a small percentage of public companies face a lawsuit against directors alleging a breach of duty that is sufficiently contentious to result in a reported judicial opinion, and a substantial fraction of these cases are dismissed. We examine possible substitutes in the United Kingdom for formal private enforcement of corporate law and find some evidence of substitutes, especially for takeover litigation. Nonetheless, our results suggest that formal private enforcement of corporate law is less central to strong securities markets than might be anticipated.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 687-722,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01157.x
411,The Effects of “Early Offers” in Medical Malpractice Cases: Evidence from Texas,"Bernard Black, David A. Hyman, Charles Silver","Medical malpractice litigation is costly and time consuming. Professor Jeffrey O'Connell, with various co-authors, has long advocated “early offer” rules that would encourage defendants to offer to settle for economic damages plus attorney fees, and punish plaintiffs who refuse such offers. Using detailed closed claims data from Texas for 1988–2005, we simulate the effects of these “early offers.” Under a base set of assumptions, early offers will sharply reduce payouts in cases with small economic damages (under $100,000, all amounts in 1988 dollars); will moderately reduce payouts in currently tried cases with economic damages from $100,000–$200,000 and would normally increase payouts (and therefore will not be made) in tried (settled) cases with economic damages over $200,000 ($100,000). Overall, we predict that early offers will be made in 72 percent of all cases, and will result in a 16 percent (20 percent) decline in payouts in tried (settled) cases. Almost all this effect comes from the sharp decline in payouts in cases with small economic damages. Defense costs will drop by roughly 60 percent (20 percent) in currently tried (settled) cases in which an early offer is made, and by about 13 percent overall. An early offer program will have very different effects on different types of plaintiffs, with especially large payout reductions for elderly and deceased plaintiffs. An early offer program also overlaps substantially in its effects with a statutory cap on noneconomic damages (which 26 states already have). Defendants in many of these states have already realized large reductions in payment of noneconomic damages; the additional reductions from an early offer program are modest and would often affect plaintiffs whose recoveries were already limited by damage caps. Our mixed results contrast sharply with dramatic claims by O'Connell and co-authors, who predict 70 percent reductions in both payouts and defense costs. Their estimates reflect the compound effects of a series of unreasonable assumptions.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 723-767,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01158.x
412,Measuring the Value of Class and Collective Action Employment Settlements: A Preliminary Assessment,"Samuel Estreicher, Kristina Yost","This article represents an initial effort to test, quantitatively, whether the class or collective action is a necessary vehicle for resolving employment disputes because typical claims are not valuable enough for individuals to pursue on their own. Because most class actions ultimately settle, this study begins the process of evaluating the hypothesis by calculating the potential recoveries individual members of class actions are likely to receive in class action settlements as a comparison point for awards obtained in individual employment arbitration. Examining public data on employment class or collective action settlements, we find that with the exception perhaps of certain “off the clock” wage-hour and ERISA claims, the average individual potential recovery found was not an insignificant amount, and though still generally smaller than the average employment arbitration awards, calls into question the “negative value” justification for the claimed superiority of class action litigation. Much work needs to be done to determine if these potential recoveries would be obtainable in individual litigation or arbitration, or whether there is something special about the class or collective action vehicle that makes possible such potential recoveries. We would also need to account for a selection bias in class action cases—that plaintiffs’ lawyers may underreport less favorable settlements and are highly selective in picking cases for class action treatment. If so, the characteristics of individual and class claims may differ in systematic ways. In the interim, our data show that potential individual recoveries for many types of employment disputes are valuable enough to place in question the arguments that these are “negative value” cases that will be brought forward, if at all, only through the class or collective action vehicle.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 768-792,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01159.x
413,Competition in the Courtroom: When Does Expert Testimony Improve Jurors' Decisions?,"Cheryl Boudreau, Mathew D. McCubbins","Many scholars lament the increasing complexity of jury trials and question whether the testimony of competing experts helps unsophisticated jurors to make informed decisions. In this article, we analyze experimentally the effects that the testimony of competing experts has on (1) sophisticated versus unsophisticated subjects' decisions and (2) subjects' decisions on difficult versus easy problems. Our results demonstrate that competing expert testimony, by itself, does not help unsophisticated subjects to behave as though they are sophisticated, nor does it help subjects make comparable decisions on difficult and easy problems. When we impose additional institutions (such as penalties for lying or a threat of verification) on the competing experts, we observe such dramatic improvements in unsophisticated subjects' decisions that the gap between their decisions and those of sophisticated subjects closes. We find similar results when the competing experts exchange reasons for why their statements may be correct. However, additional institutions and the experts' exchange of reasons are less effective at closing the gap between subjects' decisions on difficult versus easy problems.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 793-817,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01160.x
414,Contractual Complexity and the Cognitive Load of R&D Alliance Contracts,"John Hagedoorn, Geerte Hesen","We offer a new perspective on measuring the complexity of interfirm contracts. We define complex contracts as those contracts that contain many elements (clauses) with a relatively large number of interdependencies that also impose a significant cognitive load on contract parties. Previous studies on contractual complexity employ objective measures such as the number of pages, the number of kilobytes, or the number of provisions to measure this complexity. Following some suggestions in the literature, we argue that the degree to which a contract imposes a cognitive load on contract parties should be taken as another important dimension of contractual complexity. We develop a conceptual model of the complexity of contracts using a multidimensional perspective where both objective and subjective dimensions are taken into account. Our empirical analysis combines a sample of nearly 400 R&D alliance contracts in the biopharmaceutical industry with a measurement of the cognitive load of these contracts. Our findings show that quantitative, objective measures of complexity, such as length, and objective as well as subjective elements of the cognitive load of contracts, that is, the information-processing effort that contractual parties have to make, do indeed measure different aspects of contractual complexity.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 818-847,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01161.x

The data indicate that distribution channels in the form of wrappers (securities that combine different products) mitigate flow-performance sensitivity. Distribution channels via investment managers and fund distribution companies enhance flow-performance sensitivity. Funds registered in countries that have larger minimum capitalization requirements have higher levels of capital flows. Funds registered in countries that restrict the location of key service providers have lower levels of capital flows. Further, offshore fund flows and calendar effects evidenced in the data are consistent with tax factors influencing capital flows. The findings are robust to selection effects for offshore registrants, among other robustness checks.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 848-873,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01162.x
416,Race in the War on Drugs: The Social Consequences of Presidential Rhetoric,"Jeff Yates, Andrew B. Whitford","One of the president's main leadership tools for influencing the direction of U.S. legal policy is public rhetoric. Numerous studies have examined the president's use of the “bully pulpit” to lead policy by influencing Congress or public opinion, or by changing the behavior of public agencies. We argue that the president can use rhetoric to change the behavior of public agencies and that this can have important social consequences. We focus on the disproportionate impact of presidential rhetoric on different “target populations” in the context of the War on Drugs. Specifically, we observe that presidential rhetoric had a greater impact on state arrest rates for African Americans than for whites, even when controlling for alternative explanations. These findings suggest that presidential rhetoric is filtered through social constructions of public policy problems when public officials act on them.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 874-898,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01163.x
417,Assuming Elder Care Responsibility: Am I a Caregiver?,"Lindsey E. Wylie, Eve M. Brank","Caregivers of the elderly face conflicting legal demands; they must make certain the elder's needs are being met while not forcing undesired care on an adult capable of informed decisions. This dichotomy may be a reason a large number of reported elder abuse derives from unintentional neglect on behalf of informal familial caregivers. The current research examines this possibility with exploratory interviews and an experiment. The interviews between elders and their family (30 dyads) revealed that many did not intend for the living arrangements to become permanent and the nonelders were largely unprepared for the magnitude of changes and responsibilities that would result. The elders often expressed a sense of loss for their former life and feeling supernumerary in the family. In the experiment, we examined whether a person recognizes when a care-giving relationship exists and the factors that contribute to notions of being a caregiver. Results suggest that potential caregivers (124 community members) focus on the relationship with the elder more than the elder's physical and financial needs, and generally have stronger feelings of moral responsibility rather than legal responsibility to provide care.",15 December 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 4", 899-924,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01164.x

Dolan, Emily Dolan","Diversity on the jury promotes the perceived fairness of the jury system. Analyzing the jury selection and composition in 277 civil jury trials, we examine how the jury selection process and jury size, two contested features of the jury system, affect diversity. We show that while peremptory challenges were systematically related to juror race/ethnicity, the opposing challenges cancelled each other out, producing no overall effect on the makeup of the jury. In contrast, jury size had a substantial effect on minority representation. We conclude that diversity is most effectively promoted by restoring the 12-member jury.",20 August 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 3", 425-449,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01149.x

One class of the University of Virginia School of Law was studied between their matriculation in 1987 and their graduation in 1990. All 360 living graduates of this class were contacted in 2007, with a response rate of 72.2 percent. Descriptive information was obtained and empirically validated measures of both career satisfaction and life satisfaction were administered. Respondents were found to have taken many diverse career paths, with most (85 percent) having changed jobs at least once, and half having changed jobs at least twice. Gender differences in the personal and professional lives of respondents were pervasive. Women graduates were far more likely than men to interrupt or forego full-time employment (39 percent vs. 1 percent), mainly in order to care for children, and were also more likely to have a spouse or partner employed full time outside the home (77 percent vs. 24 percent). Working conditions at large private law firms emerged as a significant problem for many respondents; half of those who started their careers in large firms left to go to a different type of employer. Finally, both career satisfaction and life satisfaction were found to be high, with 81 percent of the respondents satisfied with their decision to become a lawyer, and 86 percent satisfied with their lives more broadly.",20 August 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 3", 451-483,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01150.x

We devise a new measure of nominees' political ideology that more efficiently uses preconfirmation information about the nominees. The measure employs Segal-Cover scores (based on content analysis of contemporary newspaper editorials) as well as DW-NOMINATE indicators, and is scaled into the DW-NOMINATE space. The measure predicts confirmed nominees' overall immediate, short-term, and longer-term voting behavior, as well as voting in issue-specific domains, much better than do previous measures. It is particularly successful for nominees confirmed after 1957.",20 August 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 3", 485-511,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01151.x

But, how many dissenters carry the jury, hang the jury, or conform to the majority's wishes? This article examines the formation of individual verdict preferences, the impact of deliberation, and the role of the dissenter using data from nearly 3,500 jurors who decided felony cases. Jurors were asked: “If it were entirely up to you as a one-person jury, what would your verdict have been in this case?” Over one-third of jurors, privately, would have voted against their jury's decision. Analyses identify the characteristics of jurors who dissent, and distinguish dissenters who hang the jury from dissenters who acquiesce. Deliberation procedures, juror role expectations, their evidentiary views, and their sense of fairness affected the likelihood of dissent. Contrary to previous research, deliberations play a vital role in generating juror consensus and shed new light on the debate over the requirement that juries be unanimous in their verdict.",20 August 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 3", 513-540,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01152.x
424,Empire Building and Fiscal Illusion? An Empirical Study of Government Official Behaviors in Takings,Yun-chien Chang,"An ongoing debate exists in the takings literature as to whether government officials minimize takings compensation or pay compensation to the extent that it maximizes their political interests. Until now there has been no empirical study of this question. Two methods of assessing takings compensation—one implemented by several states, the other proposed by scholars and implemented in a foreign jurisdiction—have been found to award inaccurate takings compensation to condemnees. There has been no empirical research, however, on a third assessment method, one implemented in Taiwan. Using data on takings compensation and market value in Taiwan from 2000 to 2007, I empirically examined whether the Taiwanese assessment method (in which takings compensation is predetermined by annual governmental assessments of property value) produces accurate compensation, and whether government officials minimize compensation or maximize their political interests. I found that about two-thirds of the takings compensations in Taiwan were below a reasonable proxy for a lower limit on market value and, therefore, inaccurate. Government officials could further reduce compensation payments but did not choose to do so. Condemnees were undercompensated because the more politically influential landowners have pressured the government to distort governmental assessments of property value to reduce their own tax burdens. Political interests are government officials' main concern.",20 August 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 3", 541-584,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01153.x

Congress followed with the 1997 Volunteer Protection Act. This article analyzes these acts, identifying three motivations for them: the chilling effects of tort liability, limits on liability insurance, and moral concerns. Using data from the Independent Survey's Giving and Volunteering surveys, we then identify a large and positive correlation between immunity and volunteering.

426,Does Discovery Promote Settlement? An Empirical Answer,Kuo-Chang Huang,"Law and economics scholars fiercely debate the question of whether discovery promotes settlement. The few empirical studies addressing this question in the United States have generated more questions than insights. This article reports the results of an independent empirical study designed to test discovery's effect on facilitating settlement by using official data from more than 175,000 civil cases terminated in Taiwan between 1996 and 2006. As a member of the civil-law family, Taiwan introduced the concept of discovery into its civil procedure by a 2000 reform. This empirical study shows that the settlement rate for civil cases in all the district courts indeed increased consistently over time following Taiwan's adoption of a discovery system. This article argues that Taiwan's successful experience provides evidence to support the theoretical prediction that the civilian system can enhance the settlement rate by introducing discovery into its civil procedure.",05 June 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 2", 241-278,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01143.x

Although scholars have examined the effect of nonbinding corporate law from a theoretical perspective, only inconclusive event studies explore the real-world impact of these laws. This article empirically examines the impact of nonmandatory state anti-takeover statutes. Several conclusions emerge. Despite its nonbinding nature, corporate law makes an enormous difference in outcomes, contradicting those who claim that corporate law is trivial. Two types of nonmandatory corporate laws have particularly important effects. Corporate default laws that favor management are considerably less likely to be changed by companies than default laws favoring investors, supporting those who believe that corporate default laws can ameliorate asymmetries in incentives or bargaining power between managers and investors. Corporate “menu” laws—opt-in laws that are drafted by the state but do not apply as default rules—also facilitate the use of some provisions, supporting those who believe that nonmandatory corporate law reduces transaction costs, such as the cost of updating corporate charters to reflect developments in the economy.",05 June 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 2", 279-308,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01144.x
428,Universal Health Insurance and the Effect of Cost Containment on Mortality Rates: Strokes and Heart Attacks in Japan,J. Mark Ramseyer,"For more than four decades, Japan has offered universal health insurance. Despite the demand subsidy entailed, it has kept costs low by regulatorily capping the amounts it pays doctors, particularly for the most modern and sophisticated procedures. Facing subsidized demand but stringently capped prices on complex procedures, Japanese physicians have had little incentive to invest in specialized expertise. Instead, they have invested in small private clinics and hospitals. The resulting proliferation of primitive clinics and hospitals has cut both the number of complex modern medical procedures performed, and the number of hospitals with any substantial experience in those procedures. With a quarter of the heart disease in the United States, Japan performs less than 3 percent as many coronary bypass operations and less than 6 percent as many angioplasties. Of the 855 cities and regions in Japan, 77 percent lack any hospital with substantial experience in the sophisticated modern treatment (defined below) of cerebrovascular disease, and 89 percent lack much experience in angioplasties. In this article, I estimate one of the costs of this regulatorily-driven lack of expertise. Toward that end, I combine mortality data from 855 cities with information on local hospital expertise and local demographic composition. In the typical city, I find that the addition of one hospital with substantial experience in modern stroke treatment would cut annual stroke mortality by 7 to 16 deaths. The addition of one hospital with substantial experience in angioplasties would cut the annual deaths from heart attacks in the city by over 19.",05 June 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 2", 309-342,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01145.x

However, civilian systems were catching up, suggesting that legal origin was not much of an obstacle to formal convergence in shareholder protection law. We find no evidence of a positive impact of these legal changes on stock market development.

The results yield three main conclusions. First, constitutional judges in Portugal are quite sensitive to their political affiliations and their political party's presence in government when voting.

431,Moral Judgment and Moral Heuristics in Breach of Contract,"Tess Wilkinson-Ryan, Jonathan Baron","Most people think that breaking a promise is immoral, and that a breach of contract is a kind of broken promise. However, the law does not explicitly recognize the moral context of breach of contract. Using a series of web-based questionnaires, we asked subjects to read breach of contract cases and answer questions about the legal, financial, and moral implications of each case. Our results suggest that people are quite sensitive to the moral dimensions of a breach of contract, especially the perceived intentions of the breacher. In the first study, we framed the motivation for a contractor's breach as either the chance to make more money or the chance to avoid losing money. Subjects were more punitive when the motivation appeared to be greed (breach to gain) than when the motivation appeared to be fear (breach to avoid loss). In the second study, we manipulated the timing of the negotiation over damages, comparing cases in which the promisor asks to negotiate damages before definitively breaching (as in a liquidated damages clause) with cases in which the breach has already occurred. We predicted that once the contract is breached, the moral violation becomes very salient, and we found that subjects were more punitive when setting damages ex post than ex ante. Finally, results from the third study suggest that subjects believe that intentionally breaking a contractual promise is a punishable moral harm in itself. When presented with identical losses, one from an intentional breach of contract and the other from a negligent tort, subjects were more punitive toward the breacher than the negligent tortfeasor. They treated willful breach as an intentional harm.",05 June 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 2", 405-423,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01148.x
432,Congressional Mobilization of Private Litigants: Evidence from the Civil Rights Act of 1991,Sean Farhang,"Levels of private litigation enforcing statutes are critically determined by legislative choice. I set out a theoretical framework for understanding how legislators purposefully influence the potential economic value of statutory claims, thereby establishing a market for enforcement consistent with legislative preferences. To test the theory, I examine the effects of the Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1991, which increased the value of employment discrimination claims under the CRA of 1964, and find that the law increased the number of claims filed. The origins and legislative history of the law also reveal that Congress utilized economic incentives as a policy instrument to purposefully increase private litigation, with a high degree of self-consciousness, in the course of conflict with other political actors over control of civil rights policy.",05 March 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 1", 1-34,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01136.x
433,The Screening Effect of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act,"Stephen J. Choi, Karen K. Nelson, A. C. Pritchard","Prior research shows that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) increased the significance of merit-related factors in determining the incidence and outcomes of securities fraud class actions (Johnson et al. 2007). We examine two possible explanations for this finding: the PSLRA may have reduced the incidence of nonmeritorious litigation, or it may have changed the definition of merit, effectively precluding claims that would have survived and produced a settlement pre-PSLRA. We find no evidence that pre-PSLRA claims that settled for nuisance value would be less likely to be filed under the PSLRA regime. There is evidence, however, that pre-PSLRA nonnuisance claims would be less likely to be filed under the PSLRA regime. The latter result, which we refer to as the screening effect, is particularly pronounced for claims lacking hard evidence of securities fraud or abnormal insider trading.

MacCoun","Setting the amount of a child support award involves tradeoffs in the allocation of finite resources among at least three private parties: the two parents, and their child or children. Federal law today requires states to have child support guidelines or formulas that determine child support amounts on a uniform statewide basis. These state guidelines differ in how they make these unavoidable tradeoffs. In choosing the correct balance of these competing claims, policymakers would do well to understand the public's intuitions about the appropriate tradeoffs. We report an empirical study of lay intuitions about these tradeoffs, which we compare to the principles underlying typical state guidelines. As in other contexts in which people are asked to place a dollar value on a legal claim, we find that citizen assessments of child support for particular cases conform to the pattern that Ariely and his co-authors have called “coherent arbitrariness”: the respondent's choice of dollar magnitude may be arbitrary, but relative values respond coherently to case variations, within and across citizens. These patterns also suggest that our respondents have a consistent and systematic preference with respect to the structure of child support formulas that differs in important ways from either of the two systems adopted by nearly all states.",05 March 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 1", 69-109,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01138.x
435,What is the Settlement Rate and Why Should We Care?,"Theodore Eisenberg, Charlotte Lanvers","After establishing the importance of knowledge of settlement rates, this article first shows that different research questions can yield different settlement rates. Using data gathered from about 3,300 federal cases in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA) and the Northern District of Georgia (NDGA), differing measures of settlement emerge depending on whether one is interested in (1) settlement as a proxy for plaintiffs' litigation success, or (2) settlement as a measure of litigated disputes resolved without final adjudication. Using settlement as a proxy for plaintiff success, we estimate the aggregate settlement rate across case categories in the two districts to have been 66.9 percent in 2001–2002. Regardless of the method of computing settlement rates, no reasonable estimate of settlement rates supports an aggregate rate of over 90 percent of filed cases, despite frequent references to 90 percent or higher settlement rates. The aggregate rate for the EDPA alone was 71.6 percent and for the NDGA alone was 57.8 percent, suggesting significant interdistrict variation, which persists even within case categories. We report separate settlement rates for employment discrimination, constitutional tort, contract, and tort cases in the two districts. The highest settlement rate was 87.2 percent for tort cases in the EDPA and the lowest was 27.3 percent for constitutional tort cases in the NDGA. Our results suggest a hierarchy of settlement rates. Of major case categories, tort cases tend to have the highest settlement rates, then contract cases, then employment discrimination cases, followed by constitutional tort cases. Attorney fee structure and the nature of the parties may explain settlement rate variation. Our findings provide no evidence of a material change in aggregate settlement rates over time.",05 March 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 1", 111-146,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01139.x
436,Piercing the Veil of Statewide Data: The Case of Vanishing Trials in North Carolina,Robert Moog,"Marc Galanter's 2003 report to the ABA on the declining rate of trials in federal and state courts has generated a good deal of discussion. This article adds to that literature by narrowing the focus to the fate of trials in one state (North Carolina) between 1987 and 2005, and then moving to the next level to determine if statewide trends are replicated in the six largest counties in the state. Regarding jury trials, the downward trends are quite consistent at both the state and county levels, but bench trials present a far more complex picture. Although the status of bench trials in North Carolina remains unclear, the research emphasizes the importance of the data-collection process, and the necessity of looking to the local level to understand the complexities underlying what can appear as statewide trends.",05 March 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 1", 147-176,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01140.x
437,"The Expressive Function of Trade Secret Law: Legality, Cost, Intrinsic Motivation, and Consensus",Yuval Feldman,"In recent years, leading legal scholars have proposed many competing models for the expressive function of the law. This article attempts to organize and compare the competing models while examining a real-life dilemma—sharing confidential information when one moves from one company to another—and explores the mechanisms through which the law can affect people's behavior. The article examines the expressive impact that results when trade secret laws are experimentally “primed” on factors such as: intention to share confidential information, morality of sharing confidential information, perceived proportion of other employees who would share confidential information, and the likelihood of social approval by previous and current employers for sharing confidential information. Taking a path analysis approach, I discern which models (cost related, morality related, coordination based, or reflection of consensus) best explain the mechanism responsible for the expressive effect of legality. The comparison between the models illustrates the relative legal repercussions of price, consensus, and intrinsic motivation as they relate to employees' evaluations of the prevalence and desirability of trade secret sharing norms. Based on data collected from a sample of 260 high-tech employees in the Silicon Valley, the article demonstrates that—at least in the context of trade secret law—the expressive impact is based primarily on morality and less on the law's ability to impose social and career costs.",05 March 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 1", 177-212,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01141.x
438,An Analysis of Ideological Effects in Published Versus Unpublished Judicial Opinions,"Denise M. Keele, Robert W. Malmsheimer, Donald W. Floyd, Lianjun Zhang","Almost without exception, scholars have tested theories of judicial behavior by relying on published case decisions. Though understandable given the inaccessibility of unpublished cases, this focus means that scholars may be drawing conclusions regarding judicial behavior that do not accurately describe the motivational forces behind all judicial decisions. This study employed the attitudinal model of judicial behavior to empirically test whether published judicial opinions are representative of all opinions in litigation challenging the U.S. Forest Service. Results indicate that the effects of ideological preferences are different in published and unpublished opinions issued by appellate judges: judges' decisions followed their ideological preferences in published opinions, but they did not in unpublished opinions. At the district court level, judges did not follow their ideological preferences in either published or unpublished opinions and there was no difference between judges' decisions in published and unpublished opinions. This research supports the contention that the process of judicial decision making in the courts of appeals differs between published and unpublished opinions and that scholars should use caution in drawing conclusions from examinations of published opinions alone.",05 March 2009,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 6, Issue 1", 213-239,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2009.01142.x
439,Numerical Analysis in Least Squares Regression with an Application to the Abortion-Crime Debate,"William Anderson, Martin T. Wells","Concepts of numerical analysis with applications to least squares problems are introduced in a manner the practitioner can readily apply to his or her own research problems, especially in the social sciences. Numerical analysis is mainly concerned with the accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms. We frame these concerns in terms of forward and backward error, two important concepts in helping understand the quality of the computed answers. The goal of numerical computing is to obtain correct, approximate answers to the true solution. We extended this forward and backward error framework to issues in least squares problems and check the condition of the regression problem via condition numbers. The more ill-conditioned the data are, the more sensitive the computed solution is to perturbations in the data, and the more unstable the computed solutions become. Condition numbers can also be used to signal the presence of solution degrading collinearity in regression problems. We apply the various numerical analysis tools outlined with some model diagnostics to the abortion-crime debate, and show the regression analysis used in various papers addressing the abortion-crime debate cannot be trusted.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 647-681,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00137.x
440,Why Is Elvis on Burkina Faso Postage Stamps? Cross-Country Evidence on the Commercialization of State Sovereignty,Joel Slemrod,"Why would the country of Burkina Faso issue postage stamps featuring Elvis? In part, to make money, one example of what has been called the commercialization of state sovereignty. I could issue stamps, but no one would buy them. But many philatelists (stamp collectors) want countries' stamps, especially those with popular themes like Elvis or Disney characters, in their collection. I examine the commercialization of state sovereignty by first setting out a simple model and then, in the context of the predictions of this model, conduction an empirical examination of what determines whether a country will pursue a set of commercialization opportunities, from the benign to the malign. Three examples are examined: postage stamps, tax havens, and money laundering. The data analysis provides support for the idea that commercialization of state sovereignty is more likely in countries where it is more difficult to raise revenue in alternative ways, and less support for the role of costs of commercialization related to integrity and, for less benign activities, sanctions. The examined examples of commercialization that are more likely to directly raise revenue (stamp pandering and tax havens) are more attractive to poorer countries, and stamp pandering is more attractive to more agricultural countries at a given level of per-capita income. This provides some support to the notion that when revenue is difficult to raise in other ways, revenue-raising commercialization becomes more attractive. Being a tax haven or a stamp panderer is more attractive to small countries, a finding that is consistent with the Slemrod and Wilson (2007) hypothesis about tax havens that the benefits are unrelated to size but the costs are. The results corroborate and extend the Dharmapala and Hines (2007) finding that good governance is associated with tax haven status. Notably, governance has no partial association with the probability of being a money launderer. Thus, there is no evidence that bad governance as measured by the World Bank is associated with international unlawfulness. The fact that governance matters positively for the propensity to be a stamp panderer as well as to be a tax haven expands the Dharmapala-Hines interpretation that governance proxies for a country's credibility, and suggests that governance may also be associated with the capability to undertake domestic-welfare-enhancing activities and may help to explain why more of the most desperately poor nations of the world are not involved in the commercialization of state sovereignty.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 683-712,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00138.x

City of New London, allowing governments to force the sale of private property to promote economic development, provoked bipartisan and widespread public outrage. Given that the decision in Kelo was rendered virtually inevitable by the Court's earlier public use decisions, what accounts for the dread and dismay that the decision provoked among ordinary citizens? We conducted two experiments that represent an early effort at addressing a few of the many possible causes underlying the Kelo backlash. Together, these studies suggest that the constitutional focus on public purpose in Kelo does not fully, or even principally, explain the public outrage that followed it. Our experiments suggest that subjective attachment to property looms far larger in determining the perceived justice of a taking. We have only begun to map the contours of this response, but these initial findings show promise in helping to build a more democratic model for the law and policies dealing with takings.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 713-749,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00139.x
442,"Nothing But the Truth? Experiments on Adversarial Competition, Expert Testimony, and Decision Making","Cheryl Boudreau, Mathew D. McCubbins","Many scholars debate whether a competition between experts in legal, political, or economic contexts elicits truthful information and, in turn, enables people to make informed decisions. Thus, we analyze experimentally the conditions under which competition between experts induces the experts to make truthful statements and enables jurors listening to these statements to improve their decisions. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to game theoretic predictions and contrary to critics of our adversarial legal system, competition induces enough truth telling to allow jurors to improve their decisions. Then, when we impose additional institutions (such as penalties for lying or the threat of verification) on the competing experts, we observe even larger improvements in the experts' propensity to tell the truth and in jurors' decisions. We find similar improvements when the competing experts are permitted to exchange reasons for why their statements may be correct.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 751-789,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00140.x
443,Takeover Defenses and Competition: The Role of Stakeholders,"K. J. Martijn Cremers, Vinay B. Nair, Urs Peyer","This article studies the interaction between takeover defenses and competition. We find that firms in more competitive industries have more takeover defenses. This suggests that product market competition can be a substitute for the market for corporate control, with more information available in competitive markets making monitoring less costly. A novel instrument for the incentives of stakeholders in the product market to monitor is provided by the nature of the relationship between the firm and its customers. For firms in industries with long-term relationships with customers and suppliers, these stakeholders have greater incentives to monitor. We document that stronger competition is linked to more defenses only in these “relationship” industries. Finally, we discuss the implications for the design of other governance mechanisms.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 791-818,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00141.x
444,Measuring Deviations from Expected Voting Patterns on Collegial Courts,"Paul H. Edelman, David E. Klein, Stefanie A. Lindquist","Even where idiosyncratic factors such as ideology play large and consistent roles in judges' decision making, there are always cases where the patterns of judges' votes confound our expectations. In some ways, these are among the most interesting cases for scholars, raising important questions about judicial behavior and institutions. In the first part of this article, we introduce a quantitative measure of deviations from expected voting patterns intended to allow scholars to systematically study unexpected votes and the questions they raise. In the second part, we illustrate the use of this new measure by developing a preliminary model to predict departures from strict ideological voting in the U.S. Supreme Court in an effort to distinguish alternative explanations for these patterns. Although the conventional wisdom might suggest that disordered voting occurs because of cross-cutting issues, we find little evidence that case complexity is responsible for unexpected coalitions. This result suggests that some alternative explanation exists for such voting behavior; we offer several possibilities—including the influence of legal considerations—in our conclusions.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 819-852,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00142.x

By altering the terms of the marital contract, these legal changes impacted the incentives for women to enter and remain in the labor force. Whereas earlier work suggests that the impact of unilateral divorce on female employment depends critically on laws governing property division, I show that these results are not robust to alternative specifications and controls. I find, instead, that unilateral divorce led to an increase in both married and unmarried female labor force participation, regardless of the preexisting laws regarding property division.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 853-873,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00143.x
446,To Lawyer or Not to Lawyer: Is that the Question?,Herbert M. Kritzer,"A central aspect of much of the debate over access to justice is the cost of legal services. The presumption of most participants in the debate is that individuals of limited or modest means do not obtain legal assistance because they cannot afford the cost of that assistance. The question I consider in this article is whether income is a major factor in the decision to obtain the assistance of a qualified legal professional. Drawing on data from seven different countries (the United States, England and Wales, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Japan), I examine the relationship between income and using a legal professional. The results are remarkably consistent across the seven countries: income has relatively little relationship with the decision to use a legal professional to deal with a dispute or other legal need. The decision to use a lawyer appears to be much more a function of the nature of the dispute. Even those who could afford to retain a lawyer frequently make the decision to forego that assistance, usually at about the same rate as those with limited resources. The analysis suggests that those considering access to justice issues need to grapple with the more general issues of how those with legal needs, regardless of the resources they have available, evaluate the costs and benefits of hiring a lawyer.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 875-906,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00144.x

Its main message is that policy-relevant empirical legal research should be encouraged, but the policy relevance of research, especially single studies, should not be oversold. It concludes with five points that consumers of policy-relevant empirical research should keep in mind: (1) do not rest policy change or analysis on a single study, no matter how good it is; (2) when reading the report of an empirical study, look beyond the researcher's bottom line to other relationships revealed in the data; (3) no matter how unversed one is in statistics, commonsense and a close reading of tables, graphs, and methodological narratives can take one a long way; (4) always ask about mechanism: understanding why a situation exists is as important to policy analysis as knowing whether it exists; and (5) if results seem too good to be true, this is often because they are not true.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 907-926,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00145.x
448,"Frequency and Predictors of False Conviction: Why We Know So Little, and New Data on Capital Cases","Samuel R. Gross, Barbara O'Brien","In the first part of this article, we address the problems inherent in studying wrongful convictions: our pervasive ignorance and the extreme difficulty of obtaining the data that we need to answer even basic questions. The main reason that we know so little about false convictions is that, by definition, they are hidden from view. As a result, it is nearly impossible to gather reliable data on the characteristics or even the frequency of false convictions. In addition, we have very limited data on criminal investigations and prosecutions in general, so even if we could somehow obtain data on cases of wrongful conviction, we would have inadequate data on true convictions with which to compare them. In the second part of the article, we dispel some of that ignorance by considering data on false convictions in a small but important subset of criminal cases about which we have unusually detailed information: death sentences. From 1973 on, we know basic facts about all defendants who were sentenced to death in the United States, and we know which of them were exonerated. From these data we estimate that the frequency of wrongful death sentences in the United States is at least 2.3 percent. In addition, we compare post-1973 capital exonerations in the United States to a random sample of cases of defendants who were sentenced in the same time period and ultimately executed. Based on these comparisons, we present a handful of findings on features of the investigations of capital cases, and on background facts about capital defendants, that are modest predictors of false convictions.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 927-962,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00146.x

We document households’ tax-filing behavior, attitudes about the withholding system, use of tax refunds to consume and save, and the mechanisms by which households would prefer to receive their income. We also document the prevalence of the use of tax-preparation services and the receipt of tax refunds and refund-anticipation loans.

450,Professional Overcharging in Large Bankruptcy Reorganization Cases,"Lynn M. LoPucki, Joseph W. Doherty","In an empirical study of professional fees and expenses in 74 large public company bankruptcies concluded 1998–2003, we found that (1) controlling for the trend over time and the geographical location of the cases, company size (measured by assets), case duration (measured in days), and the number of parties (measured by the number of professional firms working) explain nearly 87 percent of the case-to-case variation in professional fees, (2) fees and expenses increased about 10.4 percent per year over the six-year period covered by our study, (3) five of six predictors of fees and expenses exhibited a strong scale effect, (4) the scale effect for company size is so severe that reporting fees as a simple percentage of assets is misleading, (5) using the same model we used with court file data, our variables explain 86 percent of the case-to-case variance in the amounts of professional fees and expenses reported in SEC filing data, and (6) fees and expenses reported in SEC filing data are highly correlated with those reported in court file data, but are 58 percent higher. The principal determinants of fees and expenses—assets, days in bankruptcy, and the number of professional firms working—appear to us to measure not only the need for professional services, but also the opportunity for professionals to bill. In an attempt to statistically isolate this “billing opportunity” component of fees and expenses, we compiled a second set of variables—employees, docket length, and reorganization plan classes—that we believe measures case complexity without measuring billing opportunity. When those variables are substituted for the principal determinants, the regression explains substantially the same percentage of variance in fees and expenses. This second, complexity-only model predicts fees that, controlling for scale, are significantly lower for companies with assets greater than about $770 million. We theorize that this systematic difference in the two models' predictions measures the billing opportunity component of fees and expenses in large public company bankruptcies. That component is an overcharge because it is not warranted by the complexity of the cases, including complexity resulting from company size.",03 December 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 4", 983-1017,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00148.x

Although the Justices’ strategies in picking cases affect the observations we make and the inferences we draw, this is rarely taken into account in studies of judicial politics. In this article, we study how case selection can affect our inferences within judicial politics, including those about decision making in the Supreme Court itself (such as whether law constrains the Justices) and throughout the judicial hierarchy (such as whether lower courts comply with Supreme Court doctrine). We use simulation analysis to show that the inferential problems raised by the Court's case selection range from moderate to severe.

452,Competition and the Quality of Standard Form Contracts: The Case of Software License Agreements,Florencia Marotta-Wurgler,"Standard form contracts are pervasive. Many legal academics believe that they are unfair. Some scholars and some courts have argued that sellers with market power or facing little competitive pressure may impose one-sided standard form terms that limit their obligation to consumers. This article uses a sample of 647 software license agreements drawn from many distinct segments of the software industry to empirically investigate the relationship between competitive conditions and the quality of standard form contracts. I find little evidence for the concern that firms with market power, as measured by market concentration or firm market share, require consumers to accept particularly one-sided terms; that is, firms in both concentrated and unconcentrated software market segments, and firms with high and low market share, offer similar terms to consumers. The results have implications for the judicial analysis of standard form contract enforceability.",05 September 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 3", 447-475,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00130.x
453,The Dilemma of the Criminal Defendant with a Prior Record—Lessons from the Wrongfully Convicted,John H. Blume,"This article examines the conventional wisdom that innocent defendants will testify on their own behalf at trial. Data gathered from the cases of persons subsequently exonerated due to DNA evidence demonstrate that factually innocent defendants with criminal records do not testify on their own behalf at substantially higher rates than criminal defendants generally. Why? Ninety-one percent of factually innocent defendants with prior records declined to testify compared to the 55 percent rate at which defendants with prior criminal records declined to testify in a four-county sample of criminal cases. Why the difference? In the innocence cases, the primary reason counsel give for not taking the stand is that many of these individuals had been previously convicted of a crime, and they did not testify at trial because of the risk that their credibility would be impeached with evidence of the prior record, and that, despite any limiting instruction the court might give, the jury would infer that they were guilty based on their prior misdeeds. If one assumes that the defendants in a four-county sample are guilty, and that both the innocence sample and the four-county sample are reasonably representative, then there is a statistically significant association between defendants with criminal records failing to testify and innocence. Because the current legal regime appears to disproportionately discourage defendants, even factually innocent defendants, from telling their story at trial, the law should be changed. Only prior convictions for perjury should be potentially available for impeachment purposes.",05 September 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 3", 477-505,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00131.x
454,Statins and Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Moderate-Risk Females: A Statistical and Legal Analysis with Implications for FDA Preemption Claims,"Theodore Eisenberg, Martin T. Wells","This article presents: (1) meta-analyses of studies of cardioprotection of women and men by statins, including Lipitor (atorvastatin), and (2) a legal analysis of advertising promoting Lipitor as preventing heart attacks. The meta-analyses of primary prevention clinical trials show statistically significant benefits for men but not for women, and a statistically significant difference between men and women. The analyses do not support (1) statin use to reduce heart attacks in women based on extrapolation from men, or (2) approving or advertising statins as reducing heart attacks without qualification in a population that includes many women. The legal analysis raises the question of whether Lipitor's advertisements, which omit that Lipitor's clinical trial found slight increased risk for women, is consistent with the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act and related Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The analysis suggests that FDA regulation should not preempt state law actions challenging advertising that is not supported by FDA-approved labeling. Our findings suggesting inadequate regulation of the world's best-selling drug also counsel against courts accepting the FDA's claimed preemption of state law causes of action relating to warnings and safety. Courts evaluating preemption claims should consider actual agency performance as well as theoretical institutional competence. Billions of health-care dollars may be being wasted on statin use by women but the current regulatory regime does not create incentives to prevent such behavior.",05 September 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 3", 507-550,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00132.x

The primary study analyzes 2,054 contested litigation cases in which the plaintiffs and defendants conducted settlement negotiations, decided to reject the adverse party's settlement proposal, and proceeded to arbitration or trial. The parties' settlement positions are compared with the ultimate award or verdict, revealing a high incidence of decision-making error by both plaintiffs and defendants. This study updates and enhances three prior studies of attorney/litigant decision making, increasing the number of cases in the primary data sets more than threefold, adding 72 explanatory variables from 19 classes, applying a multivariate analysis, presenting an historical review of error rates during the 1964–2004 period, and comparing the primary study error rates with error rates in cases where the parties are represented by attorney-mediators. Notwithstanding these enhancements, the incidence and relative cost of the decision-making errors in this study are generally consistent with the three prior empirical studies, demonstrating the robustness of the earlier works by Samuel Gross and Kent Syverud, and Jeffrey Rachlinski. The multivariate analysis, moreover, shows that the incidence of decision-making error is more significantly affected by “context” variables (e.g., case type and forum) than by “actor” variables (e.g., attorney gender and experience level).",05 September 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 3", 551-591,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00133.x

The study's key findings are: (1) that the types of civil cases coming before state and federal juries differ substantially; (2) that overall plaintiff win rates are nearly the same in both state and federal courts; (3) that the damages awarded to plaintiffs in federal courts are substantially higher compared to their state counterparts; (4) that although the vast majority of jury trials take place in the state courts, the federal courts accounted for a relatively significant minority of product liability trial litigation; (5) that state courts took substantially longer to dispose of civil jury trials than federal courts; and (6) that trend data show similar patterns of declining trials and stable plaintiff win rates in both court systems.",05 September 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 3", 593-617,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00134.x
457,"Is There a Correlation Between Law Professor Publication Counts, Law Review Citation Counts, and Teaching Evaluations? An Empirical Study",Benjamin Barton,"This empirical study attempts to answer an age-old debate in legal academia: whether scholarly productivity helps or hurts teaching. The study is of an unprecedented size and scope. It covers every tenured or tenure-track faculty member at 19 U.S. law schools, a total of 623 professors. The study gathers four years of teaching evaluation data (calendar years 2000–2003) and tests for associations between the teaching data and five different measures of research productivity/scholarly influence. The results are counterintuitive: there is either no correlation or a slight positive correlation between teaching effectiveness and any of the five measures of research productivity. Given the breadth of the study, this finding is quite robust. These findings should help inform debates about teaching and scholarship among law school and other faculties and likely require some soul-searching about the interaction between the two most important functions of U.S. law schools.",05 September 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 3", 619-644,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00135.x

459,How Legal Representation Affects Case Outcomes: An Empirical Perspective from Taiwan,Kuo-Chang Huang,"Since the late 1980s, interdisciplinary scholars have conducted several empirical studies to examine to what extent legal representation affects case outcomes. Yet most of these empirical endeavors concentrate on legal representation in informal proceedings. This article revisits this question and reports the result of an independent empirical study using the official data on more than 100,000 civil cases terminated in Taiwan from 2000 to 2006. This study shows that cases are most unlikely to be settled when both parties are represented, while parties are most likely to settle a case when neither is represented. This study also shows that legal representation has no significant bearing on the case outcomes when the parties go to trial. A representation selection effect is proposed to explain these empirical results. This article argues that parties are quite apt to make deliberate and reasonable decisions on whether to seek legal representation in Taiwan and that the continental judge's active role in the adjudication process helps to explain why pro se litigants fare reasonably well in formal litigation. This study suggests that the influence of lawyers on how a case is disposed of in Taiwan may not be as strong as their colleagues' influence in the United States.",08 May 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 2", 197-238,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00123.x

Fraidin","We use a laboratory experiment to study how to prevent corporate fraud. Our experiment is the first to replicate the salient features of corporate fraud in a controlled setting. We find that requiring additional disclosures significantly reduces fraud. This finding runs counter to implications from previous research, but that research does not include many of the defining aspects of corporate fraud. Our results support the federal government's continued reliance on disclosure as a way to reduce fraud, a reliance that dates back to Louis Brandeis' observation that “publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases.

461,An Empirical Analysis of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted,Thomas J. Miles,"Police agencies regularly publish lists of wanted fugitives. These lists may serve a variety of purposes, including (1) announcement of the police agency's enforcement priorities and (2) the facilitation of fugitive apprehension. When a police agency's enforcement priorities encompass fugitives whose apprehension risks vary in their sensitivity to publicity, a tradeoff may exist between these two purposes. This article conducts the first statistical analysis of fugitives who have appeared on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Ten Most Wanted List. It reports results consistent with this tradeoff. Estimates from hazard models show that changes in the characteristics of fugitives on the list were contemporaneous with declines in the speed of apprehension and in the likelihood that information or “tips” from the public caused a fugitive's apprehension. The results suggest that as the FBI acquired responsibility to enforce a wider range of criminal activity and as other avenues for publicizing fugitives developed, it increasingly used the list to communicate its priorities rather than to locate fugitives.",08 May 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 2", 275-308,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00125.x

On average, workers recover less than 30 percent of their claim. Our strongest result is that workers receive higher percentages of their claims in settlements than in trial judgments. We also find that cases with multiple claimants against a single firm are less likely to be settled, which partially explains why workers involved in these procedures receive lower percentages of their claims. Finally, we find evidence that a worker who exaggerates his or her claim is less likely to settle.",08 May 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 2", 309-350,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00126.x
463,"The Health Cost of Civil-Law Problems: Further Evidence of Links Between Civil-Law Problems and Morbidity, and the Consequential Use of Health Services","Pascoe Pleasence, Nigel J. Balmer, Alexy Buck","There is considerable evidence of links between social and health problems. Some of these links involve social problems that can be addressed through civil legal process, and may be described as civil-law problems. Various initiatives have been implemented around the world to link health and legal advice services to promote better health and justice outcomes. This study examines the links between civil-law problems and morbidity. It uses new data to replicate an earlier analysis of these links, then builds on this by exploring the extent to which problems are reported to act to bring about ill health. It also details the reported consequent use of health services. We examined survey respondents’ self-reports of long-standing illness/disability, use of health services, and experience of 18 types of civil-law problems. Data were drawn from a random national survey of 5,015 adults living in 3,832 residential households across England and Wales. Having controlled for a range of other social and demographic predictors, we found a significant association between age-standardized illness/disability and civil-law problems, one that increases with illness/disability severity. In particular, we found significant associations with 10 of 18 principal problem types. We found that adverse health consequences were reported to have followed over one-third of problems, and some problem types in particular. This led to significant use of health services. We highlight the contribution that legal services may make to public health. We argue that despite the difficulties faced in England and Wales by initiatives such as Health Action Zones and Community Legal Services Partnerships, and despite the cost-benefit ratio of legal advice and assistance (in either the justice or health fields) remaining unclear, the more effective coordination of health and legal services is likely to improve both health and justice outcomes.",08 May 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 2", 351-373,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2008.00127.x

Wiggins, Alexander Kiss","The medical malpractice review panel is a widely adopted tort reform, but few empirical data exist regarding its utility. This cross-sectional study evaluated potential associations between the medical malpractice panel status of a state (mandatory submission panel, optional submission panel, or no panel) and measures of cost, timeliness, and efficiency of medical malpractice claims resolution for the year 2002. Effects of differences in baseline state characteristics that could affect those associations were analyzed using a multiple regression analysis. After adjusting for significant covariates among measures of socioeconomic characteristics, judicial system frequency and function, and other statutory tort reforms, multiple regression analysis found no significant relationship at the state level in the year 2002 between the predictor variable, panel status, and the dependent variables of paid loss ratio, paid defense cost ratio, reported physician malpractice payment, dollars of paid defense cost per dollar of paid loss, reported annual physician malpractice insurance premium for internal medicine, general surgery, and obstetrics/gynecology, time from incident of malpractice to payment of claim, and ratio of paid to unpaid claims (p values > 0.05).

465,Are International Merchants Stupid? Their Choice of Law Sheds Doubt on the Legal Origin Theory,Stefan Voigt,"In economics, there is currently an important discussion on the role of “legal origins” or “legal families.” Some economists claim that legal origins play a crucial role even today. Usually, they distinguish between common-law, French, Scandinavian, and German legal origin. When these legal origins are compared, countries belonging to the common-law tradition regularly come out best (with regard to many different dimensions) and countries belonging to the French legal origin worst. In international transactions, contracting parties can choose the substantive law according to which they want to structure their transactions. In this article, this choice is interpreted as a revealed preference for a specific legal regime. It is argued that the “superiority-of-common-law view” can be translated into the hypothesis that sophisticated and utility-maximizing actors would rationally choose a substantive law based on common-law tradition, such as U.K. or U.S. law. Although exact statistics are not readily available, the evidence from cases that end up in international arbitration courts (such as the International Court of Arbitration run by the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris) demonstrates that this is not the case. Hence, this evidence sheds some doubt on the superiority-of-the-common-law view.",04 February 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 1", 1-20,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00116.x

We employed a mixed-effects model to investigate the effect of malpractice risk, as measured by insurance premiums and various tort reforms, on the number of obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYNs) in the United States between 1992 and 2002. The longitudinal research design examines state-year-level data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We found that the supply of OB/GYNs had no statistically significant association with premiums or tort reforms. Our results suggest that most OB/GYNs do not respond to liability risk by relocating out of state or discontinuing their practice, and that tort reforms such as caps on noneconomic damages do not help states attract and retain high-risk specialists.",04 February 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 1", 21-53,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00117.x

Much less is understood, however, about the effects of partisanship on confirmation votes. This study investigates two aspects of partisanship: first, whether confirmation voting has become more partisan over time, even when controlling for other factors, including ideology; and second, whether partisanship modifies the influence of ideology.

This study reports on small-area variations in malpractice claim rates within New York State over a 14-year period. Counties with high rates generally had high rates over the entire period, while counties with low rates maintained low rates. Rates across counties varied considerably, with an almost five-times difference between the rates for the lowest county and the highest county. In a multivariate analysis using claim data from five years, we found median family income was one of the strongest factors positively associated with the claim rate. A measure of the risk of hospital admissions for an adverse outcome also had a strong association with the county's malpractice claim rate, but the risk factor was negatively associated with high claim rates, perhaps suggesting an association with quality of care and malpractice claims.",04 February 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 1", 77-107,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00119.x

Kritzer,"The U.S. Supreme Court's pronouncements on the standards that should govern the admission of scientific and other expert testimony, what is commonly referred to as the Daubert Trilogy, has produced substantial legal commentary and a growing body of empirical research. Most of that research focuses on decisions by courts on Daubert challenges; while there are some speculative discussions on the broader impact of Daubert, there is minimal empirical research assessing the impact of Daubert more broadly on the litigation process. Drawing on a combination of observation in a law firm and a series of interviews with practitioners, this article describes the process of decision making about Daubert-related issues. The conclusion drawn from the analysis is that Daubert has become a routinized aspect of the litigation process in a range of cases, few of which deal with the kind of controversial or innovative science at the heart of the original Daubert case.",04 February 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 1", 109-142,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00120.x
470,Amici Curiae and Dissensus on the U.S. Supreme Court,Paul M. Collins Jr.,"A great deal of empirical research has focused on explaining why U.S. Supreme Court Justices partake in nonconsensual opinion writing. However, little attention has been paid to the role of organized interests in contributing to a Justice's decision to write or join a separate opinion. I argue that a Justice's decision to engage in this behavior is a partial function of interest group amicus curiae participation in the Court. By providing the Justices with a myriad of information regarding how cases should be resolved, organized interests create ambiguity in the Justices' already uncertain decision making, at the same time providing them with a substantial foundation for concurring or dissenting opinions. I subject this argument to empirical validation by examining the Justices' decisions to author or join regular concurring, special concurring, and dissenting opinions during the 1946–1995 terms. The results indicate that organized interests play a considerable role in increasing dissensus on the Supreme Court.",04 February 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 1", 143-170,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00121.x

Colares,"When the United States and Canada agreed to replace U.S. judicial review of trade remedy cases with a new dispute mechanism under Chapter 19 of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (now the North American Free Trade Agreement), the U.S. Congress and trade negotiators stipulated that the new dispute settlement panels would apply the U.S. law and standard of review in the same manner as U.S. courts. This requirement was embodied in the text of the agreement and has at least nominally been applied by Chapter 19 panels ever since. Empirical analysis of 17 years of decisions now allows a conclusion with a high degree of confidence that Chapter 19 panels are far more likely than U.S. courts to overturn U.S. agency decisions. Not only that, but Chapter 19 panels have produced outcomes more favorable to Canadian importers than have U.S. courts. This outcome illustrates that the facial legal terms of an international agreement may give a misleading impression of how it will actually be implemented, and suggests that greater attention must be paid to how it will be interpreted and by whom.",04 February 2008,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 5, Issue 1", 171-196,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00122.x

An Empirical Analysis of Software License Agreements,Florencia Marotta-Wurgler,"The vast majority of commercial transactions are governed by standard form contracts, but little is known about their actual content and the determinants of that content. This article provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of an important class of modern standard form contracts—software license agreements. In a sample of 647 licenses for software from various markets, I document the prevalence of terms relating to license acceptance, license scope, limitations on transfer, warranties, limitations on liability, maintenance and support, and conflict resolution. I find that almost all licenses display a net bias, relative to relevant default rules, in favor of the software company (the contract writer). I also investigate firm- and buyer-type determinants of the net bias. Larger and (controlling for size) younger firms offer more one-sided terms. Firms offer similar terms to both business buyers and members of the general public. In addition to providing new insight about the nature of standard form contracts, the results may inform efforts to draft new default rules to govern software transactions.",10 December 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 4", 677-713,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00104.x
473,Rational Choice and Developmental Influences on Recidivism Among Adolescent Felony Offenders,"Jeffrey Fagan, Alex R. Piquero","Recent case law and social science both have claimed that the developmental limitations of adolescents affect their capacity for control and decision making with respect to crime, diminishing their culpability and reducing their exposure to punishment. Social science has focused on two concurrent adolescent developmental influences: the internalization of legal rules and norms that regulate social and antisocial behaviors, and the development of rationality to frame behavioral choices and decisions. The interaction of these two developmental processes, and the identification of one domain of socialization and development as the primary source of motivation or restraint in adolescence, is the focus of this article. Accordingly, we combine rational choice and legal socialization frameworks into an integrated, developmental model of criminality. We test this framework in a large sample of adolescent felony offenders who have been interviewed at six-month intervals for two years. Using hierarchical and growth curve models, we show that both legal socialization and rational choice factors influence patterns of criminal offending over time. When punishment risks and costs are salient, crime rates are lower over time. We show that procedural justice is a significant antecedent of legal socialization, but not of rational choice. We also show that both mental health and developmental maturity moderate the effects of perceived crime risks and costs on criminal offending.",10 December 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 4", 715-748,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00105.x
474,Can Corporate Governance Reforms Increase Firm Market Values? Event Study Evidence from India,"Bernard S. Black, Vikramaditya S. Khanna","A central problem in conducting an event study of the valuation effects of corporate governance reforms is that most reforms affect all firms in a country. Share price changes may reflect the reforms, but could also reflect other information. We address this identification issue by studying India's adoption of major governance reforms (Clause 49). Clause 49 requires, among other things, audit committees, a minimum number of independent directors, and CEO/CFO certification of financial statements and internal controls. The reforms were sponsored by the Confederation of Indian Industry (an organization of large Indian public firms), applied initially to larger firms, and reached smaller public firms only after a several-year lag. The difference in effective dates offers a natural experiment: large firms are the treatment group for the reforms; small firms provide a control group for other news affecting India generally. The May 1999 announcement by Indian securities regulators of plans to adopt what became Clause 49 is accompanied by a 4 percent increase in the price of large firms over a two-day event window (the announcement date plus the next trading day), relative to smaller public firms; the difference grows to 7 percent over a five-day event window and 10 percent over a two-week window.

Specifically, we examine how jurors who responded to summonses for jury duty evaluated portions of videotaped testimony involving probabilities and statistics. Although some jurors showed susceptibility to classic fallacies in interpreting conditional probabilities, the jurors as a whole were not overwhelmed by a 99.98 percent exclusion probability that the prosecution presented. Cognitive errors favoring the defense were more prevalent than ones favoring the prosecution. These findings lend scant support to the legal argument that mtDNA evidence (with modest exclusion probabilities) should be excluded because jurors are prone to overvalue such evidence. The article also introduces a new method for inferring the perceived probability of guilt that satisfies the burden of persuasion for most jurors.",10 December 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 4", 797-834,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00107.x

However, this may not be the case if hospitals externalize the bulk of these costs. Analyzing data on 465 hospital adverse events derived from medical record reviews, we investigated the amounts that hospitals and other payers incurred in medical-injury-related expenses. On average, the sampled hospitals generated injury-related costs of $2,013, and negligent-injury-related costs of $1,246, per discharge. However, hospitals bore only 22 percent of these costs.

477,A Quarter-Century of Summary Judgment Practice in Six Federal District Courts,"Joe S. Cecil, Rebecca N. Eyre, Dean Miletich, David Rindskopf","Summary judgment in federal courts has been widely regarded as an initially underused procedural device that was revitalized by the 1986 Supreme Court trilogy of Celotex, Anderson, and Matsushita. Some recent commentators believe summary judgment activity has expanded to the point that it threatens the right to trial. We examined summary judgment practice in six federal district courts during six time periods over 25 years (1975–2000), extracting information on summary judgment practice from 15,000 docket sheets in random samples of terminated cases. We found that when we controlled for changes over time in the types of cases being filed, the likelihood that a case contained one or more motions for summary judgment increased before the Supreme Court trilogy, from approximately 12 percent in 1975 to 17 percent in 1986, and has remained fairly steady at approximately 19 percent since that time. The increase prior to the 1986 trilogy and the modest changes subsequent to the trilogy would be unexpected by many legal commentators. Although summary judgment motions have increased over this 25-year period, this increase reflects, at least in part, increased filings of civil rights cases, which have always experienced a high rate of summary judgment motions. Surprisingly, no statistically significant changes over time were found in the outcome of defendants’ or plaintiffs’ summary judgment motions, again after controlling for differences across courts and types of cases. These findings call into question the interpretation that the trilogy led to expansive increases in summary judgment. Our analysis suggests, instead, that changes in civil rules and federal case-management practices prior to the trilogy may have been more important in bringing about changes in summary judgment practice.",10 December 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 4", 861-907,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00109.x

Fees to investment banks are correlated with attributes of transactions and target firms in ways that make sense if banks are being paid for processing information. The more contingent (and, therefore, risky) the fees, the higher they tend to be, all else held constant. Variation in target acquisition premia also can be explained by fundamental deal attributes. Contrary to the jaundiced view of fairness opinions, greater fixity of fees paid by targets is not generally associated with higher acquisition premia, and there is no evidence that investment banks are suborned by acquirors with whom they have had a prior banking relationship.",10 December 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 4", 909-938,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00110.x

It presents responses to survey questions relating to various personal and job characteristics, including income from the practice of law and career satisfaction. It compares the responses across various demographic groups, including type of practice, gender, race, and ethnicity. We find that lawyers in large private law firms make more money than lawyers in small private practices, who, in turn, make more than those in government or public interest positions. Career satisfaction is greatest for lawyers in corporate counsel, public interest, and government jobs, followed by larger firms, and then smaller private firms. We find that women earn substantially lower incomes than men, but most of the difference can be eliminated by accounting for time taken away from paid work for childcare, among other factors. Both blacks and Hispanics make significantly less money than majority lawyers 15 years after graduation. Regarding overall satisfaction with careers, women appear to be sensitive to the number of hours of work, probably because of child-care responsibilities.

Applying Automated Content Analysis to Enhance Empirical Legal Research,"Michael Evans, Wayne McIntosh, Jimmy Lin, Cynthia Cates","Political scientists in general and public law specialists in particular have only recently begun to exploit text classification using machine learning techniques to enable the reliable and detailed content analysis of political/legal documents on a large scale. This article provides an overview and assessment of this methodology. We describe the basics of text classification, suggest applications of the technique to enhance empirical legal research (and political science more broadly), and report results of experiments designed to test the strengths and weaknesses of alternative approaches for classifying the positions and interpreting the content of advocacy briefs submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court. We find that the Wordscores method (introduced by Laver et al. 2003), and various models using a Naïve Bayes classifier, perform well at accurately classifying the ideological direction of amicus curiae briefs submitted in the Bakke (1978) and Bollinger (2003) affirmative action cases. We also find that automated feature selection techniques can enable the detection of disparate issue conceptualizations by opposing sides in a single case, and facilitate analysis of relative linguistic “reliance” and “dominance” over time.

484,Culture and Identity-Protective Cognition: Explaining the White-Male Effect in Risk Perception,"Dan M. Kahan, Donald Braman, John Gastil, Paul Slovic, C. K. Mertz","Why do white men fear various risks less than women and minorities? Known as the “white-male effect,” this pattern is well documented but poorly understood. This article proposes a new explanation: identity-protective cognition. Putting work on the cultural theory of risk together with work on motivated cognition in social psychology suggests that individuals selectively credit and dismiss asserted dangers in a manner supportive of their cultural identities. This dynamic, it is hypothesized, drives the white-male effect, which reflects the risk skepticism that hierarchical and individualistic white males display when activities integral to their cultural identities are challenged as harmful. The article presents the results of an 1,800-person study that confirmed that cultural worldviews interact with the impact of gender and race on risk perception in patterns that suggest cultural-identity-protective cognition. It also discusses the implications of these findings for risk regulation and communication.",11 September 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 3", 465-505,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00097.x
485,The Legitimacy of the U.S. Supreme Court in a Polarized Polity,James L. Gibson,"Conventional political science wisdom holds that contemporary American politics is characterized by deep and profound partisan and ideological divisions. Unanswered is the question of whether those divisions have spilled over into threats to the legitimacy of American political institutions, such as the U.S. Supreme Court. Since the Court is often intimately involved in making policy in many issue areas that divide Americans—including the contested 2000 presidential election—it is reasonable to hypothesize that loyalty toward the institution depends on policy and/or ideological agreement and partisanship. Using data stretching from 1987 through 2005, the analysis reveals that Court support among the American people has not declined, nor is it connected to partisan and ideological identifications. Instead, support is embedded within a larger set of relatively stable democratic values. Institutional legitimacy may not be obdurate, but it does not seem to be caught up in the divisiveness that characterizes so much of American politics—at least not at present.",11 September 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 3", 507-538,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00098.x
486,Do Juries Add Value? Evidence from an Empirical Study of Jury Trial Waiver Clauses in Large Corporate Contracts,"Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey P. Miller","We study jury trial waivers in a data set of 2,816 contracts contained as exhibits in Form 8-K filings by reporting corporations during 2002. Because these contracts are associated with events deemed material to the financial condition of SEC-reporting firms, they likely are carefully negotiated by sophisticated, well-informed parties and thus provide presumptive evidence about the value associated with the availability of jury trials. A minority of contracts, about 20 percent, waived jury trials. An additional 9 percent of contracts had arbitration clauses that effectively preclude jury trials though the reason for arbitration clauses need not specifically relate to juries. We explore three groups of factors to explain the pattern of jury trial waivers: (1) contract-specific factors: the subject matter of a contract, a measure of its standardization, choice of law, and choice of forum, (2) contracting-party factors: domestic versus international status, place of business, place of incorporation, attorney locale, and industry, and (3) factors external to the contracts and parties: perceptions of jury fairness in the forum specified in the contract and the relative length of jury and bench trial queues in that forum. Contract type is significantly associated with jury trial waivers. For example, over 50 percent of security agreements and over 60 percent of credit commitments waived jury trials. In contrast, 5 percent of employment contracts, 2 percent of bond indentures, and 3.5 percent of pooling service agreements waived jury trials. The presence of a forum selection clause, greater contract standardization, and perceived fairness of juries are significantly associated with jury trial waivers. Over 80 percent of the contracts designating Illinois as a forum contained jury trial waivers whereas less than half the contracts designating New York as a forum, and only about one-third of the contracts designating California, Texas, or Florida as a forum, contained waiver clauses. Jury trial waivers were not more common in international contracts. Our results suggest that, contrary to a widespread perception about the alleged inadequacies of juries in complex business cases, sophisticated actors may perceive that juries add value to dispute resolution.",11 September 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 3", 539-588,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00099.x
487,Do Citizens Care about Federalism? An Experimental Test,"Cindy D. Kam, Robert A. Mikos","The ongoing debate over the political safeguards of federalism has essentially ignored the role that citizens might play in restraining federal power. Scholars have assumed that citizens care only about policy outcomes and will invariably support congressional legislation that satisfies their substantive policy preferences, no matter the cost to state powers. Scholars thus typically turn to institutions—the courts or institutional features of the political process—to cabin congressional authority. We argue that ignoring citizens is a mistake. We propose a new theory of the political safeguards of federalism in which citizens help to safeguard state authority. We also test our theory using evidence from a nationally representative survey experiment that focuses on the timely issue of physician-assisted suicide. We find that citizens are not single-mindedly interested in policy outcomes; trust in state governments and federalism beliefs, on the urging of political elites, reduce their willingness to support a federal ban on physician-assisted suicide.",11 September 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 3", 589-624,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00100.x
488,Administrative Appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court: The Importance of Legal Signals,Robert J. Hume,"When do federal agencies appeal adverse circuit court decisions to the U.S. Supreme Court? It is hypothesized that features of judicial opinions, such as the basis of the court's ruling and the evidence used to support it, can affect whether a petition is filed. Judges send signals in their opinions that discourage petitions, even though parties are otherwise under no legal obligation to refrain from seeking higher court review. Using an original database, this study finds that legal signals do influence the certiorari process, but that the filing of petitions is also affected by an agency's ideological preferences and the likelihood of review by the Supreme Court.",11 September 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 3", 625-649,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00101.x
489,Changing Fortunes: Results from a Randomized Trial of the Offer of Debt Advice in England and Wales,"Pascoe Pleasence, Nigel J. Balmer","A randomized trial was conducted to assess whether the offer of advice to those experiencing debt problems and who had yet to obtain any formal advice, had a positive impact on their financial and general circumstances. The participants were drawn from 16 Jobcentres (welfare offices) in 13 areas of England and Wales. In all, 402 participants were included in the trial at its outset; 234 participants remained in the trial at the 20-week followup. There was no significant difference in the rate at which intervention and control group respondents had resolved their debt problems at the 20-week followup. However, the former were significantly more likely to describe their financial position as “better” than at baseline. There was also evidence that they became more knowledgeable about their financial circumstances, more focused on dealing with priority debt, and more optimistic about their future prospects, relative to control group counterparts. These findings, though, fell short of statistical significance. The findings provide the first experimental evidence of a positive impact of the offer of debt advice. The study also highlights the difficulties of applying experimental methods in a social setting. One lesson drawn from the difficulties encountered in running this trial is that takeup is likely to be low for some forms of pro-active advice for sensitive problem types experienced among disadvantaged communities.",11 September 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 3", 651-673,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00102.x

492,Deliberation Quality: A Preliminary Examination in Criminal Juries,"Dennis J. Devine, Jennifer Buddenbaum, Stephanie Houp, Dennis P. Stolle, Nathan Studebaker","Large-scale studies of the deliberation process in actual juries have been surprisingly rare, and relatively little attention has been devoted to how well juries deliberate. This study identified a set of process-related criteria relevant to the quality of criminal jury deliberations and examined empirical relationships between indicators of these criteria and jury verdicts. Data were obtained via posttrial surveys from jurors and legal professionals associated with 179 criminal jury trials in Indiana. The quality of deliberations varied across the process criteria, with juries reportedly doing fairly well in terms of understanding their instructions and reviewing the evidence, but not as well with regard to systematically gathering input from their members, adopting an evidence-driven deliberation style, and avoiding factionalism. Several deliberation variables were also strongly related to jury verdicts, particularly the foreperson's initial verdict stance and the emergence of an identifiable pro-acquittal faction leader. Discussion of reasonable doubt and thoroughness of evidence review also tended to be negatively correlated with conviction even when strength of evidence was controlled. This study calls attention to the importance of deliberation quality.",18 June 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 2", 273-303,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00089.x
493,Estimating the Accuracy of Jury Verdicts,Bruce D. Spencer,"Average accuracy of jury verdicts for a set of cases can be studied empirically and systematically even when the correct verdict cannot be known. The key is to obtain a second rating of the verdict, for example, the judge's, as in the recent study of criminal cases in the United States by the National Center for State Courts (NCSC). That study, like the famous Kalven-Zeisel study, showed only modest judge-jury agreement. Simple estimates of jury accuracy can be developed from the judge-jury agreement rate; the judge's verdict is not taken as the gold standard. Although the estimates of accuracy are subject to error, under plausible conditions they tend to overestimate the average accuracy of jury verdicts. The jury verdict was estimated to be accurate in no more than 87 percent of the NCSC cases (which, however, should not be regarded as a representative sample with respect to jury accuracy). More refined estimates, including false conviction and false acquittal rates, are developed with models using stronger assumptions. For example, the conditional probability that the jury incorrectly convicts given that the defendant truly was not guilty (a “Type I error”) was estimated at 0.25, with an estimated standard error (s.e.) of 0.07, the conditional probability that a jury incorrectly acquits given that the defendant truly was guilty (“Type II error”) was estimated at 0.14 (s.e. 0.03), and the difference was estimated at 0.12 (s.e. 0.08). The estimated number of defendants in the NCSC cases who truly are not guilty but are convicted does seem to be smaller than the number who truly are guilty but are acquitted. The conditional probability of a wrongful conviction, given that the defendant was convicted, is estimated at 0.10 (s.e. 0.03).",18 June 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 2", 305-329,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00090.x
494,"Lay Assessors of German Administrative Courts: Fairness, Power-Distance Orientation, and Deliberation Activity",Stefan Machura,"German administrative courts employ lay assessors who decide cases together with professional judges. The mixed court is comprised of three professional judges and two lay assessors and decisions require a simple majority. This article compares the experience of East and West German lay assessors using samples from two provinces. The two groups did not differ substantially in their self-reported participation during deliberations. Issues of distributive and procedural fairness are crucial for the way lay assessors experience their work. Lay assessors disagree with professional judges more often when their sense of justice is at issue. Lay assessors are most successful when the professional judges treat them as equal partners. Female lay assessors participated less frequently than males but this was not an effect of gender distribution in the tribunal. Differences in formal education did not help explain deliberation activity. Respondents with “high” power-distance orientation (social distance between those in power and those who are to obey) less often disagreed with professional judges. This high orientation is more frequent in the East. In addition to these specific factors, the institutional setting is a most important factor affecting the experience of the lay assessors.",18 June 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 2", 331-363,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00091.x

We present the results of our empirical inquiry into the treatment of noneconomic compensatory damages by the courts from 1800–1900. Using 1,175 tort cases from this era, we show that, notwithstanding constant reiteration of jury discretion over damages, courts tightly controlled awards. In fact, no case prior to 1900 permitted a noneconomic compensatory damages award exceeding $450,000 in current dollars. Logistic regression results reveal that an increase in total monetary damages is positively and significantly related to the probability of reversal when noneconomic damages were claimed, and that comparability review decreases the probability of reversal.",18 June 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 2", 365-399,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00092.x

We hypothesize that institutional factors, socioeconomic complexity, and leadership style explain variations in the dissent rate on the High Court of Australia over time. The institutional factors that we consider are the Court's caseload, whether it had discretion to select the cases it hears, and whether it was a final court of appeal. To measure socioeconomic complexity we use the divorce rate, urbanization rate, and real GDP per capita. Our main finding is that in the long run and short run, caseload and real income are the main factors influencing dissent. We find that a 1 percent increase in caseload and real income reduce the dissent rate on the High Court of Australia by 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, holding other factors constant.",18 June 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 2", 401-425,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00093.x

Our analysis shows that many of the patterns of change described by Kagan et al. continued through the 20th century: debt and real property continued to decline and criminal continued to increase. However, other patterns of change either reversed or halted. Specifically, neither torts nor family cases have continued to increase; torts have stabilized and family cases, rather than increasing, have declined. The most surprising shift is the sharp increase in “other contract,” which had no particular pattern in the earlier data, but that represented 5 percent or less of the courts' business; in the 1990s, “other contracts” had grown to a level approaching that of public law, and exceeding real property and family and estate cases.",18 June 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 2", 427-439,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00094.x

The available data, if taken in a sufficiently big sample from numerous case categories and a range of years, indicate that foreigners have fared better in the federal courts than their domestic counterparts have fared. Thus, the data offer no support for the existence of xenophobic bias in U.S. courts. Nor do they establish xenophilia, of course. What the data do show is that case selection drives the outcomes for foreigners. Foreigners' aversion to U.S. forums can elevate the foreigners' success rates, when measured as a percentage of judgments rendered. Yet that aversion waxes and wanes over the years, having generally declined in the last 20 years but with an uptick subsequent to 9/11. Accordingly, that aversion has caused the foreigners' “advantage” to follow the same track.",18 June 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 2", 441-464,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00095.x

Four interventions are analyzed: (1) increased federal prosecutions for convicted felons carrying or using guns, (2) the length of sentences associated with federal prosecutions, (3) supply-side firearm policing activities, and (4) social marketing of deterrence and social norms messages through justice-style offender notification meetings. Using individual growth curve models and propensity scores to adjust for nonrandom group assignment of neighborhoods, our findings suggest that several PSN interventions are associated with greater declines of homicide in the treatment neighborhoods compared to the control neighborhoods. The largest effect is associated with the offender notification meetings that stress individual deterrence, normative change in offender behavior, and increasing views on legitimacy and procedural justice.

500,"Do Defendants Pay What Juries Award? Post-Verdict Haircuts in Texas Medical Malpractice Cases, 1988–2003","David A. Hyman, Bernard Black, Kathryn Zeiler, Charles Silver, William M. Sage","Legal scholars, legislators, policy advocates, and the news media frequently use jury verdicts to draw conclusions about the performance of the tort system. However, actual payouts can differ greatly from verdicts. We report evidence on post-verdict payouts from the most comprehensive longitudinal study of matched jury verdicts and payouts. Using data on all insured medical malpractice claims in Texas from 1988–2003 in which the plaintiff received at least $25,000 (in 1988 dollars) following a jury trial, we find that most jury awards received “haircuts.” Seventy-five percent of plaintiffs received a payout less than the adjusted verdict (jury verdict plus prejudgment and postjudgment interest), 20 percent received the adjusted verdict (within ± 2 percent), and 5 percent received more than the adjusted verdict. Overall, plaintiffs received a mean (median) per-case haircut of 29 percent (19 percent), and an aggregate haircut of 56 percent, relative to the adjusted verdict. The larger the verdict, the more likely and larger the haircut. For cases with a positive adjusted verdict under $100,000, 47 percent of plaintiffs received a haircut, with a mean (median) per-case haircut of 8 percent (2 percent). For cases with an adjusted verdict larger than $2.5 million, 98 percent of plaintiffs received a haircut with a mean (median) per-case haircut of 56 percent (61 percent). Insurance policy limits are the most important factor in explaining haircuts. Caps on damages in death cases and caps on punitive damages are also important, but defendants often paid substantially less than the adjusted allowed verdict. Remittitur accounts for a small percentage of the haircuts. Punitive damage awards have only a small effect on payouts. Out-of-pocket payments by physicians are rare, never large, and usually unrelated to punitive damage awards. Most cases settle, presumably in the shadow of the outcome if the case were to be tried. That outcome is not the jury award, but the actual post-verdict payout. Because defendants rarely pay what juries award, jury verdicts alone do not provide a sufficient basis for claims about the performance of the tort system.",21 March 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 1", 3-68,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00081.x

Our explanatory factors are physician demographics (age, sex, specialty, training) and physician practice pattern characteristics (practice setting, procedures performed, practice intensity, special risk factors, and characteristics of hospital(s) on staff of). We divide physicians into medical and surgical/ancillary specialty categories and fit separate models to each. In the surgical/ancillary specialty group, physician characteristics can effectively distinguish between more and less claims-prone physicians. Physician characteristics have somewhat less predictive power in the medical specialty group. As measured by predictive information, physician characteristics are superior to 10 years of claims history.

Frequency of paid claims and claims severity are used as measures of medical malpractice risk in each state. Results suggest that an increase in medical malpractice risk leads to a reduction in resource use and improvement in health outcome for patients with less severe medical conditions. For patients with more severe medical conditions, medical malpractice is associated with an improvement in mortality. Therefore, we find no evidence that the costs of defensive medicine for most AMI patients are escalating. Threat of a malpractice lawsuit lowers the mortality rate of AMI patients, contradicting the widely held view that defensive medicine has no positive effect on health status of patients.",21 March 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 1", 163-183,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00086.x
506,Reducing Medical Malpractice by Targeting Physicians Making Medical Malpractice Payments,"John L. Adams, Steven Garber","Some states use physicians' histories of medical malpractice payments to try to reduce the incidence of medical malpractice (and for other reasons). At least two types of policies fall into this category: using payments to decide which physicians will be investigated, and possibly sanctioned, by the state medical board; and making information about individual physicians' payment histories available to the public. Previous literature suggests that such policies will not be very effective because the link between medical malpractice and medical malpractice payments appears weak. Unlike previous researchers, we examine this issue directly and quantitatively. To do so, we develop a micro-simulation model of the random processes determining medical outcomes, claiming rates, and payment rates, using information from several strands of literature to calibrate its parameters. To examine sensitivity of our predictions to changes in assumptions, we also consider 14 alternative models. For each of the 15 cases, we simulate data for a population of 100,000 physicians and analyze the simulated data. We find that neither type of policy will substantially reduce the population rate of malpractice and that the policy of publicizing payment histories could, in principle, backfire.",21 March 2007,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 4, Issue 1", 185-222,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00087.x

508,Judicial Decision Making During Wartime,Tom S. Clark,"The separation of powers becomes increasingly stressed during wartime, as power is traditionally accumulated by and consolidated in the executive. This article asks to what degree the separation of powers collapses by examining judicial deference to the executive during wartime. By analyzing a set of cases in the courts of appeals from a 100-year time period, this article demonstrates that while judicial preferences undergo a fundamental shift with respect to criminal cases, there is no evidence of heightened deference to the executive during wartime. These findings suggest that a state of war has a preference-altering effect on judicial treatment of criminal defendants. They further suggest that concerns about judicial deference to the executive during times of war may not be as serious as conventional wisdom suggests.",16 November 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 3", 397-419,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00074.x
509,An Empirical Inquiry into the Relation of Corrective Justice to Distributive Justice,"Gregory Mitchell, Philip E. Tetlock","We report the results of three experiments examining the long-standing debate within tort theory over whether corrective justice is independent of, or parasitic on, distributive justice. Using a “hypothetical societies” paradigm that serves as an impartial reasoning device and permits experimental manipulation of societal conditions, we first tested support for corrective justice in a society where individual merit played no role in determining economic standing. Participants expressed strong support for a norm of corrective justice in response to intentional and unintentional torts in both just and unjust societies. The second experiment tested support for corrective justice in a society where race, rather than individual merit, determined economic standing. The distributive justice manipulation exerted greater effect here, particularly on liberal participants, but support for corrective justice remained strong among nonliberal participants, even against a background of racially unjust distributive conditions. The third experiment partially replicated the first experiment and found that the availability of government-funded insurance had little effect on demands for corrective justice. Overall, the results suggest that while extreme distributive injustice can moderate support for corrective justice, the norm of corrective justice often dominates judgments about compensatory duties associated with tortious harms.",16 November 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 3", 421-466,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00075.x
510,Placing “Standard of Care” in Context: The Impact of Witness Potential and Attorney Reputation in Medical Malpractice Litigation,"Catherine T. Harris, Ralph Peeples, Thomas B. Metzloff","Previous empirical studies have speculated about the role that factors other than negligence play in the resolution of medical malpractice claims. The present study identifies and evaluates the impact of three “strategic variables” in the medical malpractice litigation process: the witness potential of the defendant physician, the witness potential of the plaintiff, and the reputation of the plaintiff's attorney. These factors, unrelated to standard of care, make a difference in the outcome of medical malpractice cases. Data were collected from insurance company files on cases filed in the North Carolina state courts between 1991 and 1995. Analyses revealed that when the insurers’ outside (physician) reviewers rated liability as probable, based on standard of care, settlement occurred in most of the cases. However, when liability was rated as uncertain or unlikely, strategic variables such as perceived witness potential and the reputation of the plaintiff's counsel were significant predictors of case outcome. Cases in which the defendant physician had a strategic advantage were much less likely to settle, while cases in which the plaintiff had a strategic advantage were much more likely to settle.",16 November 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 3", 467-496,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00076.x
511,"Law, Ideology, and Strategy in Judicial Decision Making: Evidence from Securities Fraud Actions",Michael A. Perino,"Legal academics and political scientists continue to debate whether the legal, attitudinal, or strategic model best explains judicial decision making. One limitation in this debate is the high-court bias found in most studies. This article, by contrast, examines federal district court decisions, specifically interpretations of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Initial interpretations of the Act articulated distinct liberal and conservative positions. The data compiled here support the hypothesis that the later emergence of an intermediate interpretation was the result of strategic statutory interpretation rather than simply judges acting consistently with their ideological preferences, although there is some evidence that judges adopting the most conservative interpretation of the Act were acting consistently with the attitudinal model. There is weaker evidence to support the legal model, an unsurprising result given the severe test the study design creates for that model.",16 November 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 3", 497-524,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00077.x
512,Do Divorce Law Reforms Matter for Divorce Rates? Evidence from Portugal,"Clarisse Coelho, Nuno Garoupa","The effect of divorce law reforms on divorce rates in the United States and elsewhere has generated a controversy in the law and economics literature. In this article, we study the contribution of divorce law reforms for the evolution of divorce rates in Portugal over the last 40 years. We focus on the reforms of divorce law in the 1970s and in the 1990s as well as socioeconomic factors as determinants of the divorce rate. We find that the introduction of a modern divorce law in the 1970s had a significant effect on the divorce rate, but the changes of the 1990s that effectively implemented a generalized no-fault regime had no statistically significant impact. Our observations suggest that the reforms in the 1990s were likely the response of the legislature to growing divorce rates rather than the cause.",16 November 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 3", 525-542,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00078.x

DAPs seem to be best explained by two main reasons, a recontracting process and bargaining power of the debtor. The introduction of nonlinearities in the analysis provides some conditional support for two other reasons—asymmetric information and complexity of the cases. The study found no backing for an alternative reason, the bankruptcy venue.

The study shows a pattern in which bankruptcy courts signal a systematic tendency to limit access to exemptions based on judicial pronouncements about debtor sophistication. The data show a correlation of as much as 78.9 percent between debtors' denial of access to exemptions and judicial pronouncement of debtors' sophistication. This systemic rule conditioning access to exemptions based on debtors' sophistication emerged endogenously, without the prompting of hierarchical, exogenous forces such as congressional or appellate court directives.",16 November 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 3", 561-609,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00080.x

This examination assesses two main dimensions: tangibility (whether the employee downloaded the confidential information) and authorship (whether the employee developed the confidential information by himself or herself). The data was collected from a nonrandom multi-sourced sample of 260 high-tech employees in Silicon Valley. Tangibility affected almost all the factors that were measured (such as the perceived consensus and participants' own intention to share information), while authorship affected only participants' moral perceptions. Further analysis revealed that the expected social approval of a new employer was the most important mediator of the effect of tangibility on the intention to share trade secrets.",21 June 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 2", 197-235,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00068.x

Lindquist","In this study, we evaluate the individual voting behavior of the justices on the Rehnquist Court in cases raising constitutional challenges to federal, state, and local legislation. Using activism, federalism, and ideology as our guiding principles, we evaluate the extent to which the justices' voting behavior is consistent with the conventional wisdom that conservatives are more restraintist and more likely to protect states' rights in conformity with Chief Justice Rehnquist's focus on federalism. Although we find that there is some correlation between judicial ideology and activism, with liberals more activist than conservatives in general, we also find that the conservative wing of the Rehnquist Court is also largely guided by its own ideological reaction to the substantive policy embodied in the laws at issue. Thus, conservative justices as well as liberals are likely to strike down state laws when those laws fail to conform to the ideological preferences. This result underscores the importance of the attitudinal model of judicial behavior as an explanation of voting patterns on the Court, regardless of the justices' rhetoric in favor of judicial restraint or states' rights.",21 June 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 2", 237-261,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00069.x

518,The Use of Foreign Decisions by Federal Courts: An Empirical Analysis,David Zaring,"This article adds an empirical perspective to the debate over the use of foreign authority by federal courts. It surveys 60 years of federal court practice in citing opinions from foreign high courts using a citation count analysis. The data reveal that federal courts rarely cite to foreign decisions, they do so no more now than they did in the past, and on those few occasions where they do cite to foreign decisions, it's usually not to help them interpret domestic law. Instead, the citation of foreign decisions is best understood as a relatively rare phenomenon of judicial dialogue in cases where international issues are squarely presented by the facts. The article examines those few cases where federal courts have cited foreign decisions in some detail, and briefly considers some implications of the limited use of foreign decisions by federal courts.",21 June 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 2", 297-331,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00071.x
519,Apologies and Settlement Levers,Jennifer K. Robbennolt,"This study uses experimental methods to explore the role of apologies in legal settlement negotiation. Specifically, the study examines the influences of apologies on disputants' perceptions, and the effects of apologies on a number of judgments that influence negotiation outcomes—settlement levers such as reservation, aspirations, and judgments of fair settlement amounts. Five-hundred-fifty-six participants were asked to take the role of potential plaintiffs, to provide their reactions to an experimental scenario, and to indicate the values they would set for each settlement lever. The nature of the communication with the offender and the description of the evidentiary rule governing the admissibility of the offender's statement were manipulated. The data suggest that apologies can promote settlement by altering the injured parties' perceptions of the situation and the offender so as to make them more amenable to settlement discussions and by altering the values of the injured parties' settlement levers in ways that are likely to increase the chances of settlement. The results suggest further, however, that the nature of the apology itself, as well as the factual circumstances surrounding the incident, may play important roles in how apologies are understood.",21 June 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 2", 333-373,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00072.x

McKeague, Wei-Yann Tsai","In outcome studies of cases filed within a study window, the sample may be skewed if many cases are still pending when the window closes and not included in the study. We refer to cases that are completed within the window as “observed” and those still pending as “censored.” We propose two methods for reducing possible bias: a “self-consistent” estimator that imputes values to the censored cases and an “inverse probability weighting” estimator that assigns weights to the observed cases. In the body of the article we describe these methods for the nonmathematical reader and in the Appendix give a more mathematical treatment. We then apply the self-consistent estimator first to simulated data and then to the landmark study of reversals in death penalty cases by Professor James S. Liebman and his colleagues. In these examples the two methods are equivalent. Liebman et al. simply excluded censored cases and reported a reversal rate of 68%. Application of our methods to the Liebman data reduces the reversal rate to 62.2% (95% c.i. 60.1%, 64.4%). In general, our method largely removes the bias that affects sample estimates when censored cases are just ignored.",21 June 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 2", 375-395,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00073.x
521,Dissecting Damages: An Empirical Exploration of Sexual Harassment Awards,Catherine M. Sharkey,"My empirical study first replicates and then extends a prior preliminary empirical study by Cass Sunstein and Judy Shih of sexual harassment damages awards. It covers a comprehensive set of 232 cases in which plaintiffs won some positive amount of compensatory damages from state and federal, trial and appellate court decisions from 1982–2004 (published either in official reporters or solely on Westlaw). Contrary to Sunstein and Shih's finding, my analysis of these data reveals a consistent, and statistically significant, positive relationship between punitive and compensatory damages (at least in cases where punitive damages are awarded). My new empirical study then employs dependent variables that, in my view, are more theoretically and statistically sound than those employed by Sunstein and Shih and others who have focused exclusively on the relationship between punitive and compensatory damages: total combined damages (i.e., all compensatory and punitive damages), and what I term “outrage” damages, or combined noneconomic compensatory and punitive damages. My empirical results, using these new dependent variables, essentially confirm Sunstein and Shih's conclusions regarding the irrelevance of variables pertaining to the nature and severity of harassment. What my study reveals as crucial predictive factors, by contrast, are factors pertaining to damages limitations. My study highlights that these factors—including the effect of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and whether plaintiffs append state civil rights and tort claims to their Title VII claims—are critical to a fuller understanding of damages determinations in sexual harassment cases.",27 February 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 1", 1-45,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00061.x

Reville, Frank Neuhauser","Physician evaluations of impairment severity have a significant impact on the size of permanent disability benefits awarded to injured workers in workers' compensation. This gives both parties in a disputed claim the incentive to “shop” for physicians who will provide them with sympathetic evaluations. In this article we use data from the California workers' compensation system on competing physician evaluations for the same injury to study the extent to which the ability to select a physician results in a more favorable disability rating. We find that disability ratings based on evaluations from physicians selected by the applicant are 23 percent higher than those based on a neutral evaluation, while ratings based on a defense physician's evaluation tend to be about 5 percent lower. Moreover, we match these data to earnings loss data and estimate the extent to which applicant, defense, or neutral ratings best predict the outcomes of injured workers.

In this article we adopt a similar strategy to that employed in Smyth and Narayan (2004) to estimate both the number and location of structural breaks in concurring and dissenting opinions on the U.S. Supreme Court. Although it has commonly been believed that there has been one regime shift on the U.S. Supreme Court, corresponding to the breakdown in the consensual norm in the 1930s or 1940s, we find that there have been three breaks in consensus. We find that two of the three breaks in dissenting opinions correspond closely to the beginning of the terms of Taney and Stone as Chief Justice, with the third occurring in the middle of Chase's term. We find that two of the three breaks in concurring opinions correspond closely to the beginning of the terms of Taney and Hughes and that the third break in concurring opinions occurs in the middle of the Warren Court.",27 February 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 1", 79-98,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00063.x

Although the percent of petit jurors not selected, serving, or challenged (NSSC) in U.S. district courts has risen steadily over the last five years, reaching a national high of 39 percent in fiscal year 2002, this trend has occurred in a context of considerable district-to-district variation, ranging from 3 percent to 71 percent. Understanding this district-to-district variation will not only help courts improve their use of jurors, but also will shed light on the causes of the rising national trend. An analysis of pooled cross-sectional time-series data for 94 judicial districts between 1992 and 2002 indicates that inefficient use of jurors is largely a function of high juror supply, low juror demand, and constraints on judicial resources.",27 February 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 1", 99-120,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00064.x

In this article, I develop theoretical propositions and hypotheses concerning the impact of case characteristics on tenant defendant default and examine these hypotheses in light of data on 677 cases in a housing court. I find that allegations that are easier to dispute (those concerning a breach of lease, rather than nonpayment of rent) and higher monthly rent levels are associated with lower levels of default. Additionally, tenant default rates are highest in areas with the highest concentration of poverty. These findings reveal the importance of considering case characteristics in studies of legal participation and as a basis for organizational reform.",27 February 2006,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 3, Issue 1", 121-144,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2006.00065.x

Results indicate that 34 states had at least one lawsuit, with relatively frequent litigation taking place in a handful of states. The pace of litigation varied, however, increasing from an average of 3.2 to 9.3 cases decided per year between 1981–1990 and 1991–1994, before declining to 2.1 during 1995–2001. At one level, litigation contradicted Congress's initial intent to reduce federal oversight of state rate-setting behavior.

528,The Judicial Confirmation Process: The Difficulty with Being Smart,John R. Lott Jr,"Republicans and Democrats both complain about the difficulty in getting judges confirmed when it is their nominees who are up for confirmation, but there has not been any systematic study of either how much worse this problem has gotten or what its causes might be. Several patterns do emerge for data from the beginning of Jimmy Carter's administration through the end of George W. Bush's first term. It is taking even longer for confirmation, and the more important the position, the longer confirmation takes. Among the findings, it took almost three times longer for circuit court judges to be confirmed under George W. Bush than under his father. The rate of confirmation for circuit court judges has also fallen while the confirmation rate for district court judges has risen. Higher-quality judges, measured by their output once they are on the court (e.g., number of citations to their opinions or number of published opinions), take much longer to get confirmed. Evaluated at the mean judicial quality, a 1 percent increase in judicial quality increases the length of the confirmation process by between 1 and 3 percent. Many of the traditional ex ante measures of judicial quality such as where the judge went to law school or a nominee's American Bar Association (ABA) ratings add little if anything to predicting how well he or she will do on the bench. A 1 percent increase in polarization in the voting differences between the political parties in the Senate produces between a 3 and 10 percent increase in the length of the confirmation process for circuit court judges. Even after accounting for differences in nominee quality, Republican circuit court nominees also have significantly lower ABA ratings than Democratic nominees and ABA scores do not affect the length of circuit court confirmations.",15 September 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 3", 407-447,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00056.x

This study explores in depth a sample of cases adjudicated in California's external review program. We abstracted information from hardcopy files of several hundred cases adjudicated during 2001–2002. We describe the specific services involved in external review and the outcomes of review, analyzing the roots of disagreement in cases in which the health plan's coverage denial was overturned. We find that a subset of overturns illuminate tension in the relationship between the external review program's adjudication rules and the terms of the health insurance agreements that exist between plans and enrollees. Two critical questions face designers of external review programs: (1) What deference will be paid to specific coverage exclusions in the insurance contract between plans and enrollees? and (2) How should external review handle cases that blend medical necessity and contractual issues?",15 September 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 3", 449-468,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00057.x

This article examines the stock market response to an unusual specific performance award granted to IBP, Inc. in material adverse change (MAC) clause litigation against Tyson Foods, Inc. The combined value of Tyson and IBP rose after specific performance was granted, implying that specific performance created value. This result contrasts with other papers indirectly showing large decreases in combined market value after damages remedies are awarded. These results suggest that, from a postbreach perspective, the common law's preference for damages may be misplaced. The article identifies a number of settings, such as certain types of MAC clause controversies, wherein the use of specific performance rather than damages should be encouraged.",15 September 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 3", 469-493,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00058.x
531,As You Like It: Senior Federal Judges and the Political Economy of Judicial Tenure,Albert Yoon,"One interesting feature of the federal judiciary is that Article III judges enjoy lifetime tenure, a unique privilege not shared by members of the federal executive or legislative branches. In addition, judges who serve the requisite years can retire at full salary, guaranteed for life. Yet, the overwhelming majority of judges elect to remain on the bench for, effectively, their entire lives, first as active judges, then as senior judges. Despite the steady increase of both active and senior judges over the past century, little is known about the factors that motivate individuals to become and remain federal judges, even in the absence of financial incentives. Drawing from statistical data provided by the Federal Judicial Center and responses from a fall 2003 survey sent to all senior circuit and district federal court judges, this article describes how institutional and political developments, as well as the onset of aging, influence the capacity in which judges preside on, but not their commitment to, the federal bench.

532,Overlooked in the Tort Reform Debate: The Growth of Erroneous Removal,"Theodore Eisenberg, Trevor W. Morrison","Disputes over forum often center on whether a case should proceed in state or federal court. Removal to federal court can trigger a costly forum struggle. When a state case is removed to federal court only to be sent back to state court, the time and resources incurred in the detour are a toll on the judicial system and waste parties’ resources. We find erroneous removal to be an increasing problem. From 1993 to 2002, a period when state tort filings noticeably decreased, the number of removed diversity tort cases increased by about 10 percent to about 8,900 per year. By 2003, removed cases comprised over 30 percent of the federal diversity docket. The percentage of removals ultimately remanded to state court increased significantly to about 20 percent in 2003, with the remand rate exceeding 50 percent in some districts. Thus, as more cases purporting to satisfy diversity jurisdiction were being removed to federal court, and just as removals were occupying an increasing part of the federal docket, removed cases were being remanded to state court at increasing rates. Erroneous removal is a growing phenomenon that should be addressed as part of serious consideration of tort reform.",15 September 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 3", 551-576,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00060.x

The data present a picture of stability in most respects and moderate change in others. We do not find evidence in claim outcomes of the medical malpractice insurance crisis that produced headlines over the last several years and led to legal reform in Texas and other states. Controlling for population growth, the number of large paid claims (over $25,000 in real 1988 dollars) was roughly constant from 1990–2002. The number of smaller paid claims declined. Controlling for inflation, payout per large paid claim increased over 1988–2002 by an estimated 0.1 percent (insignificant) to 0.5 percent (marginally significant) per year, depending on the data set we use. Jury awards increased by an estimated 2.5 percent (insignificant) to 3.6 percent (marginally significant) per year, depending on the data set, but actual payouts in tried cases showed little or no time trend.

Mark Ramseyer","The Japanese “main bank system” figures prominently in the recent literature on “relationship banking,” for by most accounts the “system” epitomizes relationship finance. Traditionally (according to the literature), every large Japanese firm had a long-term relationship with one bank that served as its “main bank.” That main bank monitored the firm, intervened in its governance through board appointments, acted as the delegated monitor for other creditors, and agreed to rescue the firm if it fell into financial distress. As Japan deregulated its financial markets in the 1980s, however, these firms abandoned their relational lender for market finance. As main banks then lost their ability to constrain the firms—as relationship banking unraveled—the firms gambled in the stock and real estate bubbles, and threw the country into recession. Using financial and governance data from 1980 through 1994, we show that none of this is true. The accounts of the Japanese main bank instead represent fables, mythical stories scholars recite because they so conveniently illustrate theories and models in vogue.",27 June 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 2", 261-302,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00051.x
535,New Claims about Executions and General Deterrence: Déjà Vu All Over Again?,Richard Berk,"A number of papers have recently appeared claiming to show that in the United States executions deter serious crime. There are many statistical problems with the data analyses reported. This article addresses the problem of “influence,” which occurs when a very small and atypical fraction of the data dominate the statistical results. The number of executions by state and year is the key explanatory variable, and most states in most years execute no one. A very few states in particular years execute more than five individuals. Such values represent about 1 percent of the available observations. Reanalyses of the existing data are presented showing that claims of deterrence are a statistical artifact of this anomalous 1 percent.",27 June 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 2", 303-330,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00052.x
536,Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: Comparing Severity and Variance with Judicial Sentences in Two States,"Nancy J. King, Rosevelt L. Noble","Recently, commentators have championed sentencing by jury as more democratic and better suited to current theories of punishment than sentencing by judge alone. Yet discussions of noncapital jury sentencing either fail to address empirical questions or rely on outdated and incomplete studies. This study is the first to present basic information on the comparative severity and variance of jury and judge sentencing as practiced in the 21st century. We use archival sentencing data from two of the six states that authorize jury sentencing—Arkansas and Virginia. In both states, voluntary sentencing guidelines govern judicial sentencing after bench trial or guilty plea, but juries select sentences after jury trial. Regression analyses evaluated sentences of incarceration for individual offenses, and included as independent variables available offense, offender, and case characteristics associated with sentence severity. For most of the offenses examined, jury sentences after jury trial were both more varied and more severe than sentences selected by judges after bench trial. The findings also suggest that these disparities may be deliberately maintained by judges and prosecutors, and facilitated by state law that restricts the sentencing options and information provided to juries as compared to judges.",27 June 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 2", 331-367,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00053.x
537,Appellate Court Adherence to Precedent,Frank Cross,"Why do lower courts follow precedent, or any law? Traditional rational choice theories that rely on presumptions of ideological decision making have struggled to explain the power of judicial hierarchy. This article addresses the issue in three components. The first two sections examine the conventional positive political theory explanations for circuit court adherence to Supreme Court preferences based on a risk of reversal by the Court. These sections explain how these conventional theories cannot be theoretically sustained under prevailing resource constraints. The next two sections set forth an alternative explanation that considers the possibility of judges who possess both political and legal preferences. Using linguistic theory, these sections explain how the two types of preference could interact to produce partial adherence to precedent. The final section empirically examines circuit court decision making. This analysis shows that both political and traditional legal considerations have a significant effect on circuit court decision making, while contemporaneous Supreme Court preferences exert no discernible influence. The theoretical and empirical evidence support a conclusion that lower courts adhere to the law out of an affirmative judicial preference for such adherence rather than out of a fear of reversal by a higher court.",27 June 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 2", 369-405,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00054.x
538,Have Federal Judges Changed Their Sentencing Practices? The Shaky Empirical Foundations of the Feeney Amendment,Max Schanzenbach,"The Feeney Amendment to the PROTECT Act of 2003 restricted judicial discretion to make downward departures. Supporters of the Amendment argued that federal district court judges were increasingly departing below the ranges specified in the Sentencing Guidelines, reducing sentences and increasing sentencing disparities. Using data on all federal criminal sentences between 1993 and 2001, this article argues that federal sentencing practices did not change appreciably over the relevant time period. First, while the rate of downward departures increased, much of the increase can be explained by a number of potentially relevant variables such as type of offense, the offense level, district of sentencing, and offender characteristics. Second, even though downward departures were more frequent, average total prison sentences hardly changed. Third, there is no evidence that the increasing number of Democratic appointees on the federal district court bench affected average prison sentences or the rate of downward departures. Finally, the influence of Guidelines factors on prison sentences has remained constant.",15 March 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 1", 1-48,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00030.x

Wells","Using a uniquely complete data set of more than 50,000 observations of approximately 16,000 corporations, we test theories that seek to explain which firms become merger targets and which firms go bankrupt. We find that merger activity is much greater during prosperous periods than during recessions. In bad economic times, firms in industries with high bankruptcy rates are less likely to file for bankruptcy than they are in better years, supporting the market illiquidity arguments made by Shleifer and Vishny (1992). At the firm level, we find that, among poorly performing firms, the likelihood of merger increases with poorer performance, but among better performing firms, the relation is reversed and chances of merger increase with better performance. Such a changing relation has not been detected in prior merger studies. We also find that low-growth, resource-rich firms are prime acquisition targets and that firms’ debt capacity relates negatively to the likelihood of a merger. Debt-related variables, leverage and secured debt, play an especially prominent role in distinguishing between which firms merge and which firms go bankrupt.",15 March 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 1", 49-85,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00031.x
540,Testing the Focal Point Theory of Legal Compliance: The Effect of Third-Party Expression in an Experimental Hawk/Dove Game,"Richard H. McAdams, Janice Nadler","Economic theories of legal compliance emphasize legal sanctions, whereas psychological and sociological theories stress the perceived legitimacy of law. Without disputing the importance of either mechanism, we test a third way that law affects behavior, an expressive theory that claims law influences behavior by creating a focal point around which individuals coordinate. We investigated how various forms of third-party “cheap talk” influence the behavior of subjects in a Hawk/Dove or Chicken game. Despite the players’ conflicting interests, we found that messages highlighting an equilibrium tend to produce that outcome. Most striking, this result emerged even when the message was selected by an overtly random, mechanical process. We obtained a similar result when the message was delivered by a third-party subject; the latter effect was significantly stronger than the former only when the subject speaker was selected by a merit-based process. These results suggest that, in certain circumstances, law generates compliance not only by sanctions and legitimacy, but also by facilitating coordination around a focal outcome.",15 March 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 1", 87-123,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00032.x
541,What Counts as Fraud? An Empirical Study of Motions to Dismiss Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act,"A. C. Pritchard, Hillary A. Sale","This article presents the findings of a study of the resolution of motions to dismiss securities fraud lawsuits since the passage of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) in 1995. Our sample consists of decisions on motions to dismiss in securities class actions by district and appellate courts in the Second and Ninth Circuits for cases filed after the passage of the Reform Act to the end of 2002. These circuits are the leading circuits for the filing of securities class actions and are generally recognized as representing two ends of the securities class action spectrum. Post-PSLRA, the Second Circuit applies the least restrictive pleading standard to securities claims and the Ninth Circuit applies the most restrictive. The Ninth Circuit's post-PSLRA reputation as being a tougher venue in which to win securities fraud class actions is borne out by a significantly higher dismissal rate. The differences between the two circuits are also reflected in factors that correlate with dismissal. For example, allegations of violations of accounting principles other than revenue recognition correlate negatively with dismissal in the Second Circuit. This coefficient, however, is insignificant in our regressions for the Ninth Circuit. Allegations of revenue recognition violations are insignificant in both circuits, regardless of whether the issuer has been forced to restate those revenues. The circuits part ways on other factors as well: the Second Circuit is significantly less likely to dismiss cases with allegations of false forward-looking statements, a surprising result given the stringent standards for such statements imposed by the PSLRA. The Ninth Circuit is significantly less likely to dismiss complaints with allegations of ‘33 Act violations, and the Second Circuit is more likely to dismiss cases brought by the Milberg Weiss firm. When it comes to insider trading, however, both circuits are skeptical, and the allegations correlate with dismissal in both circuits.",15 March 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 1", 125-149,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00033.x
542,The Irrelevance of Direct Bankruptcy Costs to the Firm's Financial Reorganization Decision,"Timothy C. G. Fisher, Jocelyn Martel","We estimate the costs of reorganization and liquidation using firm-level data on 622 commercial bankruptcies filed under Canadian law (324 liquidating firms and 298 reorganizing firms). Using a hedonic pricing model of bankruptcy costs, we find the costs of liquidation and reorganization depend on firm size, the complexity of the case, and the ability of the bankrupt firm to pay. The central finding is that, contrary to theory, 40 percent of the firms opted either for reorganization or liquidation even though it was more expensive. We conclude that rational firms must base their bankruptcy decision on factors other than direct bankruptcy costs.",15 March 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 1", 151-169,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00034.x

Thomas Munsterman, Stewart J. Schwab, Martin T. Wells","This study uses a new criminal case data set to partially replicate Kalven and Zeisel's classic study of judge-jury agreement. The data show essentially the same rate of judge-jury agreement as did Kalven and Zeisel for cases tried almost 50 years ago. This study also explores judge-jury agreement as a function of evidentiary strength (as reported by both judges and juries), evidentiary complexity (as reported by both judges and juries), legal complexity (as reported by judges), and locale. Regardless of which adjudicator's view of evidentiary strength is used, judges tend to convict more than juries in cases of “middle” evidentiary strength. Judges tend to acquit more than juries in cases in which judges regard the evidence favoring the prosecution as weak. Judges tend to convict more than juries in cases in which judges regard the evidence favoring the prosecution as strong. Rates of adjudicator agreement are thus partly a function of which adjudicator's view of evidentiary strength is used, a result not available to Kalven and Zeisel, who were limited to judges’ views of the evidence. We find little evidence that evidentiary complexity or legal complexity help explain rates of judge-jury disagreement. Rather, the data support the view that judges have a lower conviction threshold than juries. Local variation exists among the sites studied. The influences of juror race, sex, and education are also considered.",15 March 2005,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 2, Issue 1", 171-207,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2005.00035.x
544,The Vanishing Trial: An Examination of Trials and Related Matters in Federal and State Courts,Marc Galanter,"This article traces the decline in the portion of cases that are terminated by trial and the decline in the absolute number of trials in various American judicial fora. The portion of federal civil cases resolved by trial fell from 11.5 percent in 1962 to 1.8 percent in 2002, continuing a long historic decline. More startling was the 60 percent decline in the absolute number of trials since the mid 1980s. The makeup of trials shifted from a predominance of torts to a predominance of civil rights, but trials are declining in every case category. A similar decline in both the percentage and the absolute number of trials is found in federal criminal cases and in bankruptcy cases. The phenomenon is not confined to the federal courts; there are comparable declines of trials, both civil and criminal, in the state courts, where the great majority of trials occur. Plausible causes for this decline include a shift in ideology and practice among litigants, lawyers, and judges. Another manifestation of this shift is the diversion of cases to alternative dispute resolution forums. Within the courts, judges conduct trials at only a fraction of the rate that their predecessors did, but they are more heavily involved in the early stages of cases. Although virtually every other indicator of legal activity is rising, trials are declining not only in relation to cases in the courts but to the size of the population and the size of the economy. The consequences of this decline for the functioning of the legal system and for the larger society remain to be explored.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 459-570,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00014.x
545,Keeping Our Ambition Under Control: The Limits of Data and Inference in Searching for the Causes and Consequences of Vanishing Trials in Federal Court,Stephen B. Burbank,"This article offers some reflections stimulated by Professor Galanter's materials, which were the common springboard for the Vanishing Trials Symposium. It suggests that other data, quantitative and qualitative, may be helpful in understanding the vanishing trials phenomenon in federal civil cases, notably data available for years prior to 1962, and questions whether it is meaningful to use total dispositions as the denominator in calculating a trial termination rate. The article argues that care should be taken in using data from state court systems, as also data from criminal cases, administrative adjudication, and ADR, lest one put at risk through careless assimilation of data or muddled thinking a project quite difficult enough without additional baggage. The article describes the limitations of data previously collected by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and highlights unique opportunities created by the AO's switch to a new Case Management/Electronic Case Files system. It argues that Professor Galanter may underestimate the influence of both changing demand for court services (docket makeup) and of changing demand for judicial services (resources) on the trial rate. Finally, the article argues that conclusions about either the causes or consequences of the vanishing trials phenomenon in federal civil cases are premature, suggesting in particular reasons to be wary of emphasis on “institutional factors” such as the discretionary power of first-instance judges and the ideology of managerial judging.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 571-590,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00015.x
546,Vanishing Trials and Summary Judgment in Federal Civil Cases: Drifting Toward Bethlehem or Gomorrah?,Stephen B. Burbank,"This article explores summary judgment from historical, empirical, and normative perspectives. It demonstrates that, because Rule 56 as promulgated in 1938 represented a radical transformation of the device, the members of the Advisory Committee had no reliable basis for predicting the consequences of their work had they been inclined to do so, and that in any event the image they projected of that work was tethered to the past. Because existing empirical studies of summary judgment based on reported decisions are unreliable, the article analyzes published studies that rely on data from court files, and it presents new such data for fiscal years 2000–2003 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The article finds that there is sufficiently reliable evidence to believe that the rate of case termination as a result of summary judgment rose substantially from 1960 to 2000, with one plausible (and perhaps conservative) range being from ca. 1.8 percent to ca. 7.7 percent. It also finds evidence that the termination and other activity rates vary, sometimes dramatically, among courts and case types. The latter possibility deserves additional empirical, doctrinal, and normative inquiry since it is reminiscent of experience under Rule 11 in the period 1983–1993 and thus, if confirmed, would prompt serious questions of procedural policy and, ultimately, of equal justice under law.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 591-626,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00016.x
547,The Case for Trials: Considering the Intangibles,Paul Butler,"In the United States, trials perform important functions that are difficult to quantify. Trials, for example, educate Americans about each other, and the law. They are a vivid, practical example of the faith in democracy that lies at the core of the American experiment. It is worrisome that trials are declining as trial arbiters—jurors and judges—become more diverse. The rejection of trials may also evidence a new and troubling cultural preference for compromise over standing on principles. The article recommends that trials be encouraged, including by reducing the costs of losing and by evaluating proposed laws and policies for the effect that they would have on trials.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 627-636,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00017.x
548,Puzzles about Supply-Side Explanations for Vanishing Trials: A New Look at Fundamentals,"Shari Seidman Diamond, Jessica Bina","The recent sharp decline in the rate of federal trials has many potential explanations. In addition to changes in the demand for trials, some commentary suggests that a shortage in judicial resources and the press of the criminal docket have led to problems of supply, inducing litigants to turn to alternative dispute resolution or other means of resolving their cases. The increased number of federal magistrate judges provides a counterweight to many of these claims about judicial shortages. Nonetheless, we show that a puzzle remains. Federal districts vary in their trial rates, and the rate of trial is negatively correlated with the number of civil cases filed per judge, regardless of whether magistrate judges are included in the total. Moreover, that relationship persists even after controlling for the rate of criminal cases filed in the district. Thus, unless other differences across districts explain the persistent negative correlation, the supply of judicial resources remains a potential contributor to the low rate of trial in the federal system, reducing the willingness of litigants to persevere until trial in districts with heavy caseloads. Prospective studies of the perceptions of litigants are needed to understand how the users of the civil justice system interpret trial signals and decide whether to resolve their dispute at trial.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 637-658,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00018.x
549,Appeal Rates and Outcomes in Tried and Nontried Cases: Further Exploration of Anti-Plaintiff Appellate Outcomes,Theodore Eisenberg,"Federal data sets covering district court and appellate court civil cases for cases terminating in fiscal years 1988 through 2000 are analyzed. Appeals are filed in 10.9 percent of filed cases, and 21.0 percent of cases if one limits the sample to cases with a definitive judgment for plaintiff or defendant. The appeal rate is 39.6 percent in tried cases compared to 10.0 percent of nontried cases. For cases with definitive judgments, the appeal filing rate is 19.0 percent in nontried cases and 40.9 percent in tried cases. Tried cases with definitive judgments are appealed to a conclusion on the merits in 22.7 percent of concluded trials compared to 10.2 percent of concluded nontried cases. Appellate courts affirm and reverse at different rates appeals from judgments for plaintiffs and defendants. Defendants achieve reversal of adverse trial court judgments in about 10 percent of filed cases and suffer affirmance in about 15 percent of such cases. Plaintiffs achieve reversal in about 4 percent of adverse trial court judgments and suffer affirmance in about 16 percent of such cases. Asymmetrical reversal rates are shown to be in part possibly attributable to different trial-win rates. But the data suggest that an appellate court effect exists, independent of trial-win rates and appeal rates, that depresses plaintiff success on appeal in employment discrimination cases.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 659-688,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00019.x

551,"Where Have All the Trials Gone? Settlements, Nontrial Adjudications, and Statistical Artifacts in the Changing Disposition of Federal Civil Cases",Gillian K. Hadfield,"If trials have been “vanishing” from the federal courts in the past few decades, it matters, from a normative perspective, whether this trend reflects an increase in private settlements (as many assume) or an increase in public nontrial adjudication. In this article I investigate the coding of “disposition” by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts as the first step in an effort to assess changes in the use of trial, nontrial adjudication (such as summary judgment and dismissal), and settlement to resolve federal civil cases. Based on audits of the 2000 data using electronic docket information available through PACER, I identify substantial “error” rates—as high as 70 percent—in the most ambiguous and relevant disposition codes, making simple interpretation of the raw codes highly unreliable. Using the sample frequencies of true dispositions determined from these audits, I correct the 2000 data. Comparing this corrected data to the raw 1970 data would lead to the surprising conclusions that a smaller percentage of cases were disposed of through settlement in 2000 than was the case in 1970, that vanishing trials have been replaced not by settlements but by nontrial adjudication, and that it is the bench, not jury, trial that has been transformed in this way. These conclusions are suggestive only, but they point to the importance of performing the more onerous task of auditing the pre-PACER data produced by the federal courts in order to assess whether we are witnessing a fundamental shift out of public adjudication into private settlements or merely a shift in how and when judges decide cases.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 705-734,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00021.x
552,Disappearing Trials? A Comparative Perspective,Herbert M. Kritzer,"Is the declining incidence of trials a uniquely American phenomenon or does it reflect a broader trend in the common-law world? To explore this question, this article examines trial patterns in England and Wales (both civil and criminal) and in the Canadian province of Ontario (civil only). There is a reasonably clear pattern of declining numbers (and rates) of civil trials in both jurisdictions examined, although in England and Wales much of the change reflects changes in jurisdiction and procedure. Some of the common patterns across the three countries may reflect the international focus of alternative dispute resolution, and some of the pattern may reflect ongoing changes in civil procedure. In England and Wales, the incidence of criminal trials in the Crown Court shows a remarkable pattern of stability, even as the number of cases rises and falls during the period examined; the reason for this pattern of stability is unclear.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 735-754,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00022.x
553,Examining Trial Trends in State Courts: 1976–2002,"Brian J. Ostrom, Shauna M. Strickland, Paula L. Hannaford-Agor","Recent examinations of federal litigation trends show that the use of trials by the federal courts is declining. This knowledge has invariably raised the question of whether the use of trials in state courts is also declining. Unfortunately, the ability to conduct parallel examinations of state court litigation trends has been hampered by the lack of available state court disposition data. In this article we introduce the “State Court Disposition Trends” database and analyze, for the first time, long-term trial trends in the state courts. The present analysis examines 27-year trends of trials and trial rates for criminal, civil, and felony cases, and 11-year trends of trials and trial rates for general civil cases. We find that despite substantial growth in the number of case dispositions, there has been a decrease, often significant, in the use of trials by state courts.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 755-782,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00023.x
554,"Migrating, Morphing, and Vanishing: The Empirical and Normative Puzzles of Declining Trial Rates in Courts",Judith Resnik,"This article explores competing explanations of the data on declining rates of trials in the federal courts of the United States. One possibility is that while trials have declined in courts, trials have migrated elsewhere, resulting in a proliferation of adjudicatory processes. The proliferation thesis has plausibility because of the positive political significance now attached to trials and the adjudicatory processes for which they stand. Conversely, a second analysis of the data focuses instead on the rarity of trials in courts and the negative rhetoric and rules stemming from courts about trials. The data could mark the privatization of disputing processes, whether located in or out of courts. The available data also reveal the political and economic incentives and capabilities of the legal profession. The gaps in data on adjudication in state courts and within agencies reflect the lower priority paid to those kinds of claims. The disparity between the federal system and the others (which provide adjudicatory mechanisms for most complainants in the United States) illustrates the impoverishment of public provisions for dispute resolution. History, law, and tradition also support public access to courts, making them more transparent than more recently invented decision-making centers. But one should not assume the stability of either the equation of courts with public access or the equation of administrative agencies and private providers with secrecy. Courts’ processes are increasingly private, prompting the question of whether to insist (as some judges and state legislators now do) on public access to information about outcomes (settlements included) that are generated through courts, or to permit invisible and sometimes secret resolutions. Whether trials are migrating, morphing, or vanishing, the normative questions now pending are whether a role ought to be preserved for public participation in dispute resolution in either courts or their alternatives and how public resources will be distributed to support either sector.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 783-841,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00024.x
555,ADR and the “Vanishing Trial”: The Growth and Impact of “Alternative Dispute Resolution”,Thomas J. Stipanowich,"In the past quarter-century, significant changes have occurred in the ways lawyers approach conflict. There have been unprecedented efforts to develop strategies aimed at more efficient, less costly, and more satisfying resolution of conflict, including more extensive and appropriate use of mediation and other “alternative dispute resolution” (ADR) approaches. This study examines what we know and do not know about the growth and impact of ADR in federal and state courts, in the business sector, and in employment and consumer settings. The analysis examines the relationship between ADR and court trial, but also underlines the broader uses of and rationale for mediation and other process choices. Although there is clear positive evidence of cost and time savings and numerous other benefits of some court-annexed ADR programs, it is evident that much depends on the shape and structure of such programs. Studies of ADR in commercial sectors suggest that the use of mediation has grown in recent years, reflecting perceptions that it offers significant potential benefits to business. Some businesses have developed more integrated, systematic approaches to the management of conflict, although most appear to have taken a more ad hoc, reactive approach to dispute resolution. There are many different kinds of programs for the management of employee grievances, including stepped processes that usually resolve disputes without adjudication. Several scholars have begun to develop a body of data on experience and perceptions of employees and their counsel. The availability of data on investor/broker arbitration is critical for promoting transparency and fairness in the securities field. Lawyers have a growing number of tools for providing clients with appropriate ways of managing and resolving conflict, but we still have much to learn about these choices. Quantitative and qualitative research is essential to provide guideposts for the future.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 843-912,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00025.x
556,Vanishing Trials: The Bankruptcy Experience,Elizabeth Warren,"The federal bankruptcy system provides two critical points of comparison with data about the overall trends of federal lawsuits and trials. The first is the rising number of bankruptcy filings, which indicates that a growing number of collection actions and debtor-creditor disputes are funneled into the bankruptcy system for relatively quick, cheap resolution. The second point of comparison focuses on adversary proceedings, the lawsuit-like subset of disputes that sometimes are resolved within a bankruptcy. The trend lines here suggest that the number of adversary proceedings filed is climbing, while the number of such disputes that are actually resolved by trial is declining. Like the data about the federal court system generally, these data suggest that the trial is quietly vanishing from the bankruptcy system. Data about the number of judges and about business and nonbusiness bankruptcy cases make it possible to explore two competing hypotheses—a Judicial Workload Hypothesis and a Cost Hypothesis—to explain the overall findings. The data are not conclusive, but they are consistent with the view that judicial workloads explain less of the decline in the number of trials than an increase in litigants’ costs of resolving disputes in bankruptcy. The data are also consistent with a vision of bankruptcy as an evolving process that is increasingly standardized (and cheaper) for nonbusiness debtors, while it is highly individualized (and more costly) for business cases. If that vision is right, it has implications both for understanding the changing role of the trial and for considering various statutory proposals to differentiate further the treatment of large business, small business, and nonbusiness cases.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 913-942,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00026.x
557,"Getting What We Asked For, Getting What We Paid For, and Not Liking What We Got: The Vanishing Civil Trial",Stephen C. Yeazell,"The current rate of civil trials may result from two converging trends in civil practice: 20th-century procedural reforms and associated changes in the organization and financing of legal practice. The procedural reforms required greater pretrial investigation of facts, which in turn often required litigants to make regular investments of substantial capital, access to which was facilitated by changes in the organization of plaintiffs’ practices. Together, these procedural reforms and changes in practice structure provide a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon of declining rate and number of civil trials.",04 November 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 3", 943-971,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00027.x

560,A Broken System: The Persistent Patterns of Reversals of Death Sentences in the United States,"Andrew Gelman, James S. Liebman, Valerie West, Alexander Kiss","We collected data on the appeals process for all death sentences in U.S. states between 1973 and 1995. The reversal rate was high, with an estimated chance of at least two-thirds that any death sentence would be overturned by a state or federal appeals court. Multilevel regression models fit to the data by state and year indicate that high reversal rates are strongly associated with higher death-sentencing rates and lower rates of apprehending and imprisoning violent offenders. In light of our empirical findings, we discuss potential remedies including “streamlining” the appeals process and restricting the death penalty to the “worst of the worst” offenders.",14 June 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 2", 209-261,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00007.x
561,Was Arthur Andersen Different? An Empirical Examination of Major Accounting Firm Audits of Large Clients,"Theodore Eisenberg, Jonathan R. Macey","Enron and other corporate financial scandals focused attention on the accounting industry in general and on Arthur Andersen in particular. Part of the policy response to Enron, the criminal prosecution of Andersen eliminated one of the few major audit firms capable of auditing many large public corporations. This article explores whether Andersen's performance, as measured by frequency of financial restatements, measurably differed from that of other large auditors. Financial restatements trigger significant negative market reactions and their frequency can be viewed as a measure of accounting performance. We analyze the financial restatement activity of approximately 1,000 large public firms from 1997 through 2001. After controlling for client size, region, time, and industry, we find no evidence that Andersen's performance significantly differed from that of other large accounting firms.",14 June 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 2", 263-300,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00008.x

Balmer, Alexy Buck, Aoife O'Grady, Hazel Genn","Justiciable problems do not always occur in isolation. However, little empirical research has examined multiple problems in depth by identifying common clusters of problems, their extent, and those who experience them. The Legal Services Research Centre's Periodic Survey of Justiciable Problems is a large-scale survey undertaken in England and Wales, documenting 5,611 respondents’ experience of 21 discrete problem categories. Having assessed the overall incidence and overlap of problem types, hierarchical cluster analysis, based on each respondent's experience of these categories, was used to identify clusters. We then established social and demographic predictors of each cluster using mixed-effects Poisson regression and examined each problem type's likelihood of overlapping with further problems, both within and between identified clusters. We highlight policy implications of our findings, particularly concerning developing “joined-up” solutions to multiple “joined-up” problems.",14 June 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 2", 301-329,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00009.x
563,Criminal Case Complexity: An Empirical Perspective,Michael Heise,"Criminal case complexity persists as a central tenet in many academic and public critiques of our legal system even though little is known about two critical questions. One question is whether key actors (juries, attorneys, and judges) view case complexity similarly. In other words, do juries, attorneys, and judges agree on whether a case is complex? A second question involves the determinants of case complexity for each group. That is, what factors make a case more (or less) complex for juries, attorneys, and judges. This article explores both questions from an empirical perspective with the benefit of recent data from four jurisdictions. The data are important because, within the context of criminal cases, they permit analyses of agreement levels among the three key actors. Results suggest that the three sets of actors possess slightly different views on whether cases are complex. Judges reported the lowest levels of case complexity; jurors the highest. Moreover, important variation exists in terms of what made cases complex for each group. The results implicate legal reform efforts. No clear consensus exists among the critical actors on complexity perceptions. Many of the variables that influence case complexity fall outside of reformers’ reach. Variables within the reach of policy do not appear to systematically reduce case complexity.",14 June 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 2", 331-369,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00010.x
564,Juror First Votes in Criminal Trials,"Stephen P. Garvey, Paula Hannaford-Agor, Valerie P. Hans, Nicole L. Mott, G. Thomas Munsterman, Martin T. Wells","What explains the way in which jurors cast their first vote in a criminal trial, before the dynamics of the deliberation process take over? Analysis of 3,000 jurors in criminal trials in four major metropolitan areas indicates, consistent with prior research, that jurors pay great attention to the evidence. The stronger the evidence against the defendant, the more likely the juror is to vote guilty. We also find that jurors dislike police duplicity. Police officers who give unbelievable testimony will, all else being equal, push jurors toward a first vote of not guilty. Beyond that, our conclusions are specific and limited to a particular jurisdiction. A juror's beliefs about the fairness of the law or the harshness of the consequences of conviction make a difference in some jurisdictions under some circumstances, but not in other jurisdictions under different circumstances. We also find that African-American jurors in the District of Columbia sitting on cases involving minority defendants charged with drug offenses are, unlike jurors in other jurisdictions, less likely to vote for conviction on the first ballot (but not on the final one) compared to white jurors. Our results therefore highlight the importance of analyzing juror behavior at a more local level. Analyzing juror behavior at the aggregate level can conceal important local variation.",14 June 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 2", 371-398,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00011.x
565,Hail to the Chief! Leadership and Structural Change in the Level of Consensus on the High Court of Australia,"Russell Smyth, Paresh Kumar Narayan","This article identifies structural breaks in dissenting and single opinions on the High Court of Australia and uses a recent method proposed by Caporale and Grier (2002) to examine the effect of leadership on variations in the dissent rate between 1904 and 2001. Although there has been much speculation about the effectiveness of different Chief Justices in obtaining consensus on the Court, to this point most of the evidence has been anecdotal. Our main findings are that the structural breaks that we identify coincide with major turning points in the leadership of the Court and that leadership has been important in explaining variations in the proportion of dissenting opinions on the Court.",14 June 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 2", 399-427,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00012.x
566,How Employment Discrimination Plaintiffs Fare in Federal Court,"Kevin M. Clermont, Stewart J. Schwab","This article presents the full range of information that the Administrative Office's data convey on federal employment discrimination litigation. From that information, the authors tell three stories about (1) bringing these claims, (2) their outcome in the district court, and (3) the effect of appeal. Each of these stories is a sad one for employment discrimination plaintiffs: relatively often, the numerous plaintiffs must pursue their claims all the way through trial, which is usually a jury trial; at both pretrial and trial these plaintiffs lose disproportionately often, in all the various types of employment discrimination cases; and employment discrimination litigants appeal more often than other litigants, with the defendants doing far better on those appeals than the plaintiffs.",14 June 2004,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 2", 429-458,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00013.x

569,Forty Years of Civil Jury Verdicts,"Seth A. Seabury, Nicholas M. Pace, Robert T. Reville","Debate over civil justice reform in the United States frequently centers on the extent to which damage awards granted by juries have been escalating over time. However, past studies on civil juries have been hampered by lack of data on verdicts spanning a sufficiently long time period. Average jury awards tend to be highly variable from year to year, making it difficult to distinguish trends over relatively short periods of time. We use the longest time series of data on jury verdicts ever assembled: 40 years of data on tort cases in San Francisco County, CA and Cook County, IL collected by the RAND Institute for Civil Justice. We find that while there has been a substantial increase in the average award amount in real dollars, much of this trend is explained by changes in the mix of cases, particularly a decreasing fraction of automobile cases and an increase in medical malpractice. Claimed economic losses, in particular claimed medical losses, also explain a great deal of the increase. Although there appears to be some unexplained growth in awards for certain types of cases, this growth is cancelled out on average by declines in awards in other types of cases.",01 December 2003,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 1", 1-25,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00001.x
570,Attorney Fees in Class Action Settlements: An Empirical Study,"Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey P. Miller","Study of two comprehensive class action case data sets covering 1993–2002 shows that the amount of client recovery is overwhelmingly the most important determinant of the attorney fee award. Even in cases in which the courts engage in the lodestar calculation (the product of reasonable hours and a reasonable hourly rate), the client's recovery generally explains the pattern of awards better than the lodestar. Thus, the time and expense of a lodestar calculation may be wasteful. We also find no robust evidence that either recoveries for plaintiffs or fees of their attorneys increased over time. The mean fee award in common fund cases is well below the widely quoted one-third figure, constituting 21.9 percent of the recovery across all cases for a comprehensive data set of published cases. A scaling effect exists: fees constitute a lower percent of the client's recovery as the client's recovery increases. Fees are also correlated with risk: the presence of high risk is associated with a higher fee, while low-risk cases generate lower fees. Fees as a percent of class recovery were found to be higher in federal than state court. The presence of “soft” relief (such as injunctive relief or coupons) has no material effect on the fee, regardless of whether the soft relief was included in the quantified benefit for the class used as the basis for computing the attorney fee. The study also addresses costs and expenses. Like fees, these display significant scale effects. The article proposes a simple methodology by which courts can evaluate the reasonableness of fee requests.",01 December 2003,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 1", 27-78,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00002.x
571,Determinants of Civil Rights Filings in Federal District Court by Jail and Prison Inmates,"Anne Morrison Piehl, Margo Schlanger","This article uses panel data estimation techniques to examine the relation between the number of federal court civil filings by inmates and jail and state prison populations (and, hence, the relation between jail and prison inmate filing rates) both before and after the effective date, in 1996, of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). The research issue matters for several reasons. First, the amount of litigation by inmates is a crucial component of the regulatory regime governing jails and prisons and thus what factors drive filings, and by how much, deserves close attention and assessment. In addition, the PLRA was a major congressional attempt to control and ration litigation; understanding its effects in finer gauge seems itself worthwhile. Finally, we hope to show, methodologically, how research about litigation rates can be carried out sensitively, even if the litigation results from case filings by two separate populations. We make three major findings. (1) As expected, inmate filings vary positively with prison population. However, the relationship with jail population is less secure. (2) As the prison proportion of inmates in a particular state increases, so too does the number of filings. (3) The PLRA's passage has significantly lessened but not eliminated this prison proportion effect.",01 December 2003,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 1", 79-109,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00003.x

Using a sample of 303 firms attempting reorganization in Canada during 1977–1988, we find that Type I errors (accepting a plan from a nonviable firm) are four times more likely to occur than Type II errors (rejecting a plan from a viable firm) and that the incidence of filtering failure is between 22 and 53 percent or 18 and 44 percent, depending on the definition of a firm's viability.",01 December 2003,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 1", 143-164,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00005.x
574,Explaining Death Row's Population and Racial Composition,"John Blume, Theodore Eisenberg, Martin T. Wells","Twenty-three years of murder and death sentence data show how murder demographics help explain death row populations. Nevada and Oklahoma are the most death-prone states; Texas's death sentence rate is below the national mean. Accounting for the race of murderers establishes that black representation on death row is lower than black representation in the population of murder offenders. This disproportion results from reluctance to seek or impose death in black defendant-black victim cases, which more than offsets eagerness to seek and impose death in black defendant-white victim cases. Death sentence rates in black defendant-white victim cases far exceed those in either black defendant-black victim cases or white defendant-white victim cases. The disproportion survives because there are many more black defendant-black victim murders, which are underrepresented on death row, than there are black defendant-white victim murders, which are overrepresented on death row.",01 December 2003,Journal of Empirical Legal Studies,"Volume 1, Issue 1", 165-207,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00006.x
