0,Trumping Capacity Gap with Negotiation Strategies: the Mexican USMCA Negotiation Experience,"['Amrita Bahri', ' Monica Lugo']","In the past few months, we have witnessed the ‘worst deal’ in the history of the USA become the ‘best deal’ in the history of the USA. The negotiation leading to the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) appeared as an ‘asymmetrical exchange’ scenario that could have led to an unbalanced outcome for Mexico. However, Mexico stood firm on its positions and negotiated a modernized version of North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico faced various challenges during this renegotiation, not only because it was required to negotiate with two developed countries but also due to the high level of ambition and demands raised by the new US administration. This paper provides an account of these impediments. More importantly, it analyzes the strategies that Mexico used to overcome the resource constraints it faced amidst the unpredictable political dilemma in the US and at home. In this manner, this paper seeks to provide a blueprint of strategies that other developing countries could employ to overcome their negotiation capacity constraints, especially when they are dealing with developed countries and in uncertain political environments.", 09 February 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 1–23, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz029
1,Reimagining Trade-Plus Compliance: The Labor Story,['Kathleen Claussen'],"Trade agreements today are omnibus instruments characterized by extensive commitments in areas referred to as ‘trade-plus’ because they expand the traditional notion of trade. This Article offers an original challenge to the jumbled consensus that including trade-plus provisions in trade agreements and treating them like ‘ordinary’ trade issues subject to dispute settlement is all positive. Nowhere was this more obvious than in the outcome of the USA–Guatemala labor case under the US trade agreement with the Central American states. The Article critically considers for the first time the broader implications of the USA–Guatemala case for the framing of the system and concludes that the trade dispute settlement system is not well suited for these types of questions in its present iteration. In so doing, the Article seeks to draw attention to the disparity in theory and design in free trade agreements and to make some critical policy recommendations for the ongoing debate about the content and structure of trade agreements in the USA and beyond.", 14 January 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 25–43, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz033
2,A Really Big Button That Doesn’t Do Anything? The Anti-NME Clause in US Trade Agreements Between Law and Geoeconomics,['Geraldo Vidigal'],"The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) features a clause, dubbed ‘anti-China’, which sets out legal consequences in case one of the parties negotiates or enters into a free trade agreement (FTA) with a nonmarket economy (NME). A similarly worded objective appears among the negotiating objectives of the US for FTAs with the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom. This article examines the anti-NME clause, arguing that its concrete legal consequences are less relevant than its symbolic effects. The USMCA clause itself is difficult to replicate in bilateral agreements, since it depends on cooperation between the two nonsigning parties. Its operation is nonetheless similar to that of two unilateral remedies available under the law of treaties, permitting a reasonable assessment that the clause, if it follows its original design, will aim to permit termination of bilateral US FTAs in response to the other party entering into an NME FTA. While such a clause would offer little in terms of concrete effects if added to agreements that already permit unilateral withdrawal, its greatest value may not be in its legal effects but in its legitimating and signaling properties, which push USMCA parties to establish a common front in the ‘geoeconomic’ dispute between the United States and China.", 18 March 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 45–64, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa001
3,"Trade in Services in the African Continental Free Trade Area: Prospects, Challenges and WTO Compatibility",['Regis Y Simo'],"This article engages with the recently adopted agreement for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in the area of services. While services trade had heretofore stood at the queue of African trade pacts, the AfCFTA breaks new grounds by negotiating goods and services concurrently, signalling a paradigm shift and a commitment to a deeper integration of the continent. Upon Members’ implementation of the Protocol on Trade in Services, whose aim is to establish a single market in services, the region will be the largest economic integration agreement ever concluded since the birth of the World Trade Organization (WTO). This paper sets out to analyse the provisions of the Protocol and how they contribute to achieving the objective of attaining a single market where services (alongside goods, people and capital) move unrestricted.", 14 January 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 65–95, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz031
4,ASEAN at the Crossroads: Trap and Track between CPTPP and RCEP,['Chien-Huei Wu'],"In the wake of the mega-free trade agreements, all of the 10 member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations are determined to participate in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and to maintain the centrality of the Association of South East Asian Nations whereas Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam have also opted for the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. In view of divergent positions of member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, this paper asks two questions: empirically, what drives individual member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations toward the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership; normatively, do the different positions embraced by member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations weaken the coherence of external relations of the Association of South East Asian Nations and undermine its centrality in Asian regionalism. I argued that Singapore’s participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership is mainly motivated by its wish to set the rules of free trade agreements in the Asian Pacific. Brunel aims to diversify its domestic economy and to undergo economic reform through international commitments. Vietnam and Malaysia joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership with a view to accessing American market, but Vietnam’s Trans-Pacific Partnership participation should also be understood in the context of its aggressive free trade agreements strategy. This paper argues that solidarity within member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations does not prevent economically advanced member countries from participating in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership for market access; nonetheless, the need of Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar should be taken into account through special and differential treatment in Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiations.", 27 November 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 97–117, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz032
5,Energy Pricing Policies and the International Trade Regime,['Tom S H Moerenhout'],"Energy subsidy and pricing reform is widely heralded as a necessity to transition to sustainable development and keep global warming below 2°C. Energy pricing policies and subsidies are also at the heart of the energy–trade–climate nexus, but progress has been slow within the international trade regime. This is unlike other international organizations or networks, where progress has been more substantial. This article investigates the lack of legitimacy to regulate or coordinate pricing reform and links it to fundamentally divergent interests between fuel producers and importers. The article discusses the regulatory and coordinative potential of the World Trade Organization and preferential trade agreements. It finds that at the World Trade Organization, the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, the Anti-Dumping Agreement, case law, Ricardian theory, and negotiation history all preempt the consideration of most pricing policies as subsidies. As a result, subsidy notification within the World Trade Organization is low and while other options for improving transparency via the Committee on Trade and Environment and Trade Policy Review Mechanism have been suggested, not much has actually happened because producers protect their comparative advantage. Therefore, support for fuel pricing reform remains on a general level via Ministerial Statements or through general provisions in preferential trade agreements that reconfirm the G-20 and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation commitments to fuel subsidy reform. The only real advancement has been made within bilateral trade negotiations where heavyweights such as the European Union can push trading partners to abandon dual pricing policies.", 18 November 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 119–141, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz026
6,Clash of Trade and National Public Interest in WTO Law: The Illusion of ‘Weighing and Balancing’ and the Theory of Reservation,['Csongor István Nagy'],"In the last two decades, World Trade Organization law’s public interest exceptions (Article XX GATT, Article XIV GATS, Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement, and Article 20 TRIPS) have seen the emergence and evolution of the doctrine of ‘weighing and balancing.’ This paper provides a criticism of this doctrine through a comparative ontological analysis and demonstrates three propositions. First, it shows that the concept of ‘weighing and balancing’ results from the ill-considered reception of a doctrine pertaining to federal systems. Second, the paper demonstrates through the analysis of the case law that the role of ‘weighing and balancing’ is rather poetical and, in reality, the Appellate Body does not engage in balancing. Third, it proposes that an outspoken ‘necessity’ analysis should be carried out that is tailored to arrangements based on contractual promises and is guided by the notion of quasi-reservation. The paper re-conceptualizes the Appellate Body’s case law and elaborates a doctrinal framework warranted by the function of World Trade Organization law’s public interest exceptions.", 23 January 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 143–163, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz028
7,Cross-Cumulation Arrangement as FTA Under GATT Article XXIV,['Jong Bum Kim'],"A cross-cumulation arrangement helps manufacturers meet the demands of the global value chain economy by facilitating the sourcing of intermediate products within the territories of participants in the arrangement. It is a de facto free-trade area formed by a network of bilateral free-trade areas underpinning the arrangement. However, a cross-cumulation clause provided in a bilateral free-trade area that underpins a cross-cumulation arrangement is inconsistent with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Articles I and III because the intermediate products from the participants in the arrangement are more favorably treated than products from non-participants in the arrangement. The GATT inconsistencies of a cross-cumulation clause cannot be justified by the GATT Article XXIV exception, because a cross-cumulation clause of a bilateral free-trade area derogates from the free-trade area’s aim by facilitating trade in intermediate products between the free-trade area parties and non-parties to the free-trade area that are participants in the arrangement. In contrast, a cumulation clause provided in a free-trade area contributes to the free-trade area’s aim by facilitating trade in intermediate products between the parties to the free-trade area. To bring a cross-cumulation arrangement such as the Regional Convention on Pan-Euro-Med Preferential Rules of Origin into conformity with World Trade Organization law, the arrangement and its underlying free-trade areas should be recognized as a de jure free-trade area under GATT Article XXIV and notified to the World Trade Organization as such. A large cross-cumulation arrangement as a mega-free-trade area is likely to contribute to the world trading system by harmonizing divergent free-trade area rules of origin and providing an efficient mechanism for the formation of a mega-free-trade area.", 25 November 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 165–185, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz027
8,Digital Trade Provisions in Preferential Trade Agreements: Introducing a New Dataset,"['Mira Burri', ' Rodrigo Polanco']","The article introduces a new dataset that seeks to comprehensively trace developments in the area of digital trade governance. The TAPED (Trade Agreements Provisions on Electronic-Commerce and Data) dataset includes a detailed mapping and coding of all preferential trade agreements that cover chapters, provisions, annexes, and side documents that directly or indirectly regulate digital trade. This article presents the methodology behind TAPED and provides an overview of the evolution of digital trade provisions in preferential trade agreements, highlighting also some emerging trends. It then takes a look at the substance of selected rules found particularly in electronic commerce chapters and maps the diversity of approaches in tackling issues meant to facilitate online trade, such as the customs duty moratorium on electronic transactions or paperless trading, and discusses the very recent rule-making with regard to cross-border data flows. This is of course merely a glimpse of the wealth of information that TAPED provides, and the goal of this article is simply to uncover the great variety and the complexity of the norms found in the preferential trade agreements on digital trade governance, which reveals the value of the dataset.", 31 January 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 187–220, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz044
9,"Agreement Forthcoming? A Comparison of EU, US, and Chinese RTAs in Times of Plurilateral E-Commerce Negotiations",['Ines Willemyns'],"This paper discusses the results of a study into the evolution of electronic commerce-related provisions in regional trade agreements (RTAs) and supplements them with a tripartite comparison of the e-commerce provisions in Chinese, EU, and US RTAs. As trade barriers related to electronic commerce are becoming ever more important in the global trade landscape and no explicit provisions exist at the multilateral level, it can be expected that WTO Members increasingly include provisions addressing such barriers, and electronic commerce more generally, at the bilateral and regional levels. This study applies a term-frequency analysis to the whole body of RTAs that contain e-commerce-related provisions, mapping the evolution of e-commerce chapters over time. Subsequently, a legal analysis is conducted on the e-commerce terms that were found in Chinese, EU, and US RTAs. Based on these Members’ position at the multilateral level, the e-commerce topics covered in their RTAs, and the nature of the provisions included, the paper aims to assess the convergences and divergences in their approach to e-commerce at the bilateral level and to draw lessons for the ongoing WTO plurilateral negotiations on the trade-related aspects of electronic commerce.", 13 March 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 221–244, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz048
10,CHINESE PUZZLE: ANATOMY OF THE (INVISIBLE) BELT AND ROAD INVESTMENT TREATY,"['Julien Chaisse', ' Jamieson Kirkwood']","This article makes a major contribution to the emerging Belt and Road Initiative scholarship (and international economic law) by highlighting that (i) China’s existing investment treaty network along the Belt and Road is dated, (ii) many or most of those treaties include Most Favored Nation provisions, (iii) these treaties have hitherto been subject to a static three generations analysis which does not reflect the reality, and (iv) there is significant authority supporting the use of the Most Favoured Nation provisions by Chinese investors to upgrade the Belt and Road Initiative investment treaty network. This article demonstrates that an investment treaty for the Belt and Road Initiative already exists via the Most Favored Nation clause present in China’s bilateral investment treaties. Moreover, the article further identifies that China’s treaty network is unique (by being so extensive) and assesses the potential for investment claims in light of Belt and Road Initiative jurisdictions past involvements in Investor–State Dispute Settlement, and by doing so, the article sheds a new light on the predicted increased use of such procedure by Chinese investors.", 13 February 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 245–269, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz047
11,The Achmea Judgment and the Applicability of the Energy Charter Treaty in Intra-EU Investment Arbitration,['J Robert Basedow'],"The Energy Charter Treaty is the most frequently used investment treaty worldwide to launch investment arbitration against host states. The vast majority of disputes is of intra-European Union nature in that they involve an EU investor as claimant and an European Union member state as respondent. The recent Achmea judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union may thus have ramifications for the Energy Charter Treaty. The judgment has triggered a heated legal and political debate within the European Union over the future of intra-European Union investment arbitration. In the context of this debate, the European Commission claimed that the application of the Energy Charter Treaty in intra-European Union investment disputes is based on an incorrect interpretation of this treaty. This article critically assesses the Commission’s statement by evaluating the travaux préparatoires of the Energy Charter Treaty as a supplementary means of interpretation. It finds that the European Union member states and the European Commission in all likelihood opted for a mixed ratification for legal reasons rather than to ensure its intra-European Union applicability. Indeed, the EU initially pushed for a disconnection clause to prevent the application of the Energy Charter Treaty in intra-European Union relations but dropped this request during the negotiations. At least from a historical perspective then, the Commission’s claim that the Energy Charter Treaty is not meant to apply in intra-European Union relations is inaccurate in that the European Union consciously accepted this possibility.", 31 January 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 1, March 2020, Pages 271–292, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz025
