0,THE HEALTH REGULATION OF BIOTECH FOODS UNDER THE WTO AGREEMENTS,"['Nick Covelli', ' Viktor Hohots']","This article provides a roadmap through the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements that may have a bearing on the regulation of genetically modified food products in relation to human health, including the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement, Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, and Article XX(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It also considers the roles of WTO-recognized international standard-setting organizations like the Codex Alimentarius Commission, and the interface between the WTO Agreements and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.", 01 December 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 4, December 2003, Pages 773–795, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.4.773
1,"TRADE SANCTIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS - PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE",['Carlos Manuel Vázquez'],"The relationship between the international law of trade and the international law of human rights has commanded an increasing amount of scholarly attention in the past few years, perhaps spurred by the well-known events at Seattle in 1999. This article offers some reflections on this relationship, focusing on the permissibility under international law of imposing trade sanctions against nations that commit violations of international human rights. Part I begins with some reflections on the historical relationship between these two bodies of law. Part I also considers why the human rights community appears to feel threatened by the international trade system, and not the other way around. Part II considers whether, under current trade norms, trade concessions may be suspended in response to human rights violations. Part III turns to the normative question: how should the WTO address human rights?", 01 December 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 4, December 2003, Pages 797–839, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.4.797
2,RETHINKING THE SOVEREIGNTY DEBATE IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW,['Kal Raustiala'],"Many observers argue that sovereignty is threatened by the ongoing expansion of international economic institutions. This article explores a school of thought that counterintuitively argues that institutions such as the World Trade Organization in fact strengthen sovereignty. These theories collectively highlight an under-explored proposition: that changes in the international system or in domestic politics have already compromised sovereignty and thus international institutions, while rendering the erosion of sovereignty more legible, actually serve as a means to reassert or reclaim sovereignty. These ideas are important for two reasons. First, they challenge prevailing wisdom and thus offer an alternative guide for policy. Second, they suggest that our conceptions of sovereignty are unduly narrow and may be increasingly anachronistic. In particular, scholars must consider more deeply the purpose and role of sovereignty in the contemporary world.", 01 December 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 4, December 2003, Pages 841–878, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.4.841
3,WTO DISCIPLINES ON FISHERIES SUBSIDIES: A HISTORIC STEP TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY?,['Seung Wha Chang'],"The Doha Ministerial Declaration mandates the WTO Negotiating Group on Rules to ‘clarify and improve WTO Disciplines on fisheries subsidies’. Under this mandate, the so-called ‘Friends of Fish’ currently propose to adopt special sectoral disciplines on fisheries subsidies that directly and primarily aim at preserving fish resources. This paper examines whether and to what extent proposals by Friends of Fish can be justified, as a matter of law and policy. This paper first demonstrates that: (i) the current SCM Agreement may resolve fisheries subsidies issues to a considerable extent through dispute settlement; (ii) some limits of the SCM Agreement originate mostly from the generic imperfectness of the current SCM rules that apply equally to other sectors, rather than from unique features of the fisheries sector. Therefore, WTO Members may preferably move forwards negotiating on special disciplines only for residual matters that dispute settlement or cross-sectoral negotiations on SCM rules cannot effectively address. The Doha mandate cannot be construed as legally authorizing WTO Members to adopt special disciplines on fisheries subsidies as proposed by Friends of Fish, which would be a significant step beyond the trade-oriented WTO mission. As a matter of policy, such a move by the WTO towards sustainability would be an historic step for the WTO, but it would be justified only when proposed disciplines are accompanied by appropriate means to avoid or at least minimize an institutional systemic risk for the WTO. Current proposals by Friends of Fish seem to lack such a safety net. This paper concludes with several recommendations for WTO Members in dealing with fisheries subsidies issues so as to maintain a systemic balance and minimize an institutional risk for the WTO as a multilateral trading system.", 01 December 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 4, December 2003, Pages 879–921, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.4.879
