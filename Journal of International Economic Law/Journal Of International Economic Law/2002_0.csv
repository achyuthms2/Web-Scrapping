0,Judicial Enforcement of WTO Law in the European Union – Some Further Reflections,['Piet Eeckhout'],"This essay re‐examines the recent case‐law of the European Court of Justice and European Court of First Instance on the effect of WTO law in the EC legal system, particularly the judgment in Portugal v Council. The author takes issue with the critiques of that judgment, and attempts to defend the Court's exclusion of full direct effect, from a number of different perspectives. The second part of the essay looks into the types of legal effect of WTO law which the European courts do recognize, such as the principles of interpretation and implementation. It is argued that particularly the latter principle offers useful avenues for judicial communication.", 01 March 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 1, March 2002, Pages 91–110, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.1.91
1,Human Rights Sanctions and International Trade: A Theory of Compatibility,['Sarah H. Cleveland'],"This article examines the compliance of unilateral trade sanctions designed to promote human rights abroad with GATT trade liberalization principles. Using examples from US trade measures, the article defines unilateral human rights sanctions as falling into three categories: tailored, semi‐tailored, and general sanctions. The article then evaluates the compliance of these three types of sanctions with the GATT text and recent WTO interpretations. It argues that while the GATT appears to preclude many unilateral human rights trade measures, particularly those involving semi‐tailored and general sanctions, the GATT text reasonably can be read to accommodate certain human rights sanctions. These include those targeting human rights and labor violations that occur in production of goods for export, GSP measures, restrictions on military technology, and general trade measures targeting jus cogens violations such as genocide. The article concludes that such an interpretive approach to the GATT is necessary in order for trade liberalization to develop consistent with fundamental human rights norms and the broader substantive requirements of the international legal system.", 01 March 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 1, March 2002, Pages 133–189, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.1.133
