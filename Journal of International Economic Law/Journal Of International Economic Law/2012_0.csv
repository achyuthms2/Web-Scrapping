0,Fight Against Corruption: Sanctions Regimes of Multilateral Development Banks,"['Norbert Seiler', ' Jelena Madir']","Much has been written about the consequences for companies of criminal convictions for bribery and other corrupt practices. However, less attention has been paid to the sanction regimes that have been developed by multilateral development banks (MDBs) in order to combat fraud and corruption in their operations. This may change in view of the fact that, on 9 April 2010, the heads of five leading MDBs—the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank—signed an agreement providing for mutual and reciprocal enforcement of debarment decisions. The Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions (the ‘Agreement’) thus increased the risk faced by commercial organizations that do business in the developing world, while affirming the MDBs' commitment to combating fraudulent, corrupt and collusive practices. Consequently, companies will need to invigorate their procedures with a view to managing their risks not only in relation to national legislation, but also in relation to the MDBs' sanctioning authorities, which have much broader geographic scope than that of national legislations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the UK Bribery Act. This article first provides a brief history of anti-corruption measures taken by the MDBs and examines the tenets of collective enforcement action established by the Agreement. Further, as the signatories of the Agreement continue to maintain their own sanctions mechanisms, the article analyses the individual sanctions systems of each of the five signatories of the Agreement. Finally, the article describes the types of sanctions that may be imposed by MDBs and looks at some of the challenging issues surrounding MDBs' sanctions practices.", 23 January 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 5–28, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr037
1,China’s Participation in WTO Dispute Settlement Over the Past Decade: Experiences and Impacts,['Chi Manjiao'],"The year 2011 marked the 10th year of China’s World Trade Organization (WTO) membership. Acceding to the WTO demonstrates China’s attempt to integrate in the global trading system as one of the world’s biggest economies. To date, China has been involved in 31 WTO cases as complainant or respondent and has gradually become one of the most frequent users of WTO dispute settlement mechanism. This article provides a skeletal review of China’s participation in WTO dispute settlement over the past decade and analyzes some of its salient and systematic impacts on China. Active participation in WTO dispute settlement inevitably poses challenges to China, but it is helpful for China to improve its trade and social–political governance regimes and to maintain healthy and constructive trade relations with other WTO members.", 06 March 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 29–49, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs002
2,Promises and Pitfalls of the European Union Policy on Foreign Investment—How will the New EU Competence on FDI affect the Emerging Global Regime?,['Julien Chaisse'],"This article analyses constitutional changes and policy consequences concerning the transfer to the supranational level of an external competence in the field of investment resulting from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It states that EU Member States lose their competence to conclude investment treaties and to analyse legal innovations at the EU level. The new comprehensive European investment policy may enable the EU to utilize its leverage to negotiate favourable terms with non-Member States and consistency in protection standards worldwide, leading to an even (as well as a superior) playing field for EU investors. This horizon, however, is darkened by technical, but important, issues of investment treaties implementation and the uncertain future of existing investment treaties signed by Member States. This article shows that these legal innovations offer a rich canvas against which international legal issues of ‘systemic importance’ are discussed, while policy lessons covering preferential trade policy and the next generation of investment treaties are explored. Legal issues and policy strategies will in turn impact the international regime for investment.", 21 February 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 51–84, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs001
3,Investment Protection and EU Law: The Intra- and Extra-EU Dimension of the Energy Charter Treaty,['Jan Kleinheisterkamp'],"The interaction of investment treaty law with European Union (EU) law is a growing concern not only for policy makers but also for investors and arbitral tribunals, especially in the energy sector. This article sketches the existing and potential legal problems between the regimes with the aim of drawing conclusions on the impact of those tensions on the future of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). In the first part, the article discusses the problem of the compatibility of investment treaty law with EU law in general that may require EU member states to renegotiate their existing agreements. The second part is dedicated to the more controversial issues of the continuing applicability of intra-EU investment treaties, discussing their far-reaching overlap with the protection afforded by EU law and the resulting complications. Most of these problems also arise under the ECT, in addition to the specific complications that are analysed in the third part. The article also outlines the consequences of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and finishes with a summary and outlook of the general importance of these European developments for the future of the ECT.", 28 February 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 85–109, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs004
4,Climate Change and Trade—The EU Aviation Directive and the WTO,['Joshua Meltzer'],"With limited progress in the UN climate change negotiations, the EU has been looking at ways to further reduce global CO2 emissions by extending the scope of its cap and trade system, most recently by including flights entering and leaving EU airspace. With the EU Aviation Directive entering into force on 1 January 2012, all airlines will need to hold permits to cover their CO2 emissions for flights operating in EU airspace. For instance, Singapore Airlines will be required to hold permits for CO2 emissions for its flights from Singapore to Frankfurt, which will include all CO2 emissions over Singapore, third countries, the high seas and EU airspace. As climate change is a global challenge, national and regional efforts to reduce CO2 emissions have an international impact by nature, particularly on trade. With the World Trade Organization (WTO) responsible for regulating world trade, this article analyses the consistency of the EU Aviation Directive with WTO rules. The EU's decision to include both non-EU and EU airlines under its cap and trade system is a response to the so-called carbon leakage and competitiveness issues that would have arisen if the scheme had been limited to EU airlines only. Carbon leakage arises when a carbon price leads domestic businesses to relocate to countries not pricing carbon or to increased imports of goods from countries not pricing carbon, resulting in no net reduction in global CO2 emissions. Competitiveness issues occur when a carbon price increases the price of domestically produced goods, causing consumers to substitute with cheaper imports from countries not pricing carbon, ultimately harming domestic industry and undermining support for these policies. With airlines providing an important international services trade, including CO2 emissions from aviation under the EU cap and trade system has important implications for international trade, particularly since air transport functions as an enabler of other forms of trade such as just-in-time manufacturing strategies, tourism, and business links. Despite the number of ways in which the Aviation Directive is in conflict with WTO rules, the article demonstrates that the type of WTO rules that the EU Aviation might violate are useful disciplines on how countries develop and apply climate change action that impedes international trade. Developing climate change measures consistently with WTO rules strikes an appropriate balance between giving WTO Members the policy space to take action to reduce CO2 emissions while maintaining an open and non-discriminatory trading system that supports economic growth and global welfare.", 02 February 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 111–156, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr036
5,"Biofuels, Sustainability, and Trade-Related Regulatory Chill",['Emily Barrett Lydgate'],"Recent European Union sustainability criteria for biofuels provide an opportunity to understand more precisely the relationship between national sustainable development policies and World Trade Organization (WTO) law. A desire to avoid WTO conflict was one reason for the omission of stronger criteria addressing negative social and environmental impacts of increased biofuels production. Thus, despite declarations of sustainable development’s central importance in WTO legal texts and statements by the Secretariat, national sustainability regulations risked trade law conflict. This article documents potential reasons for a WTO regulatory chill effect on the sustainability criteria. It then outlines challenges that the regulatory concept poses to trade law, which result primarily from its breadth and complexity, as well as the lack of targeted international standards, and its emphasis on production processes which intrude heavily, in an extraterritorial sense, on importers. It is important to identify these limitations to the mutual supportiveness between trade liberalization and national policies to achieve sustainability goals. However, despite these limitations, the case study also suggests that, with regard to sustainability criteria, sustainable development’s soft power as a WTO legal principle is an important source of influence.", 15 March 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 157–180, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs007
6,Export Cartels: Is it Legal to Target your Neighbour? Analysis in Light of Recent Case Law,['Marek Martyniszyn'],"Despite the growing sophistication of antitrust regimes around the world, export cartels benefit from special treatment: they are almost universally tolerated, if not encouraged in the countries of origin. Economists do not offer an unambiguous policy recommendation on how to deal with them in part due to the lack of empirical data. This article discusses arguments for and against export cartels and it identifies the existing gaps in the present regulatory framework. The theoretical part is followed by an analysis of the recent case law: a US cartel challenged with different outcomes in India and South Africa, as well as Chinese export cartels pursued in the USA. The Chinese cases are particularly topical as the conduct at stake, apart from being subject to private antitrust actions before US courts, was also challenged within the WTO dispute settlement framework, pointing out to the existing interface between trade and competition. While the recent developments prove that unaddressed issues tend not to vanish, the new South–North dimension has the potential of placing export cartels again on the international agenda. Pragmatic thinking suggests looking for the solution within the WTO framework.", 28 February 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 181–222, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs003
7,Indirect Expropriation and the Right to Regulate: Revisiting Proportionality Analysis and the Standard of Review in Investor-State Arbitration,['Caroline Henckels'],"International investment tribunals considering claims of indirect expropriation have increasingly taken into account the host state’s regulatory purpose in their analysis, alluding to the need for measures to achieve a balance between host state and investor interests. Some tribunals have attempted to employ proportionality analysis in their determination of claims, but their reasoning has been methodologically problematic and characterized by a stringent standard of review, diverging from the approach of other international and supranational fora hearing disputes concerning the exercise of public power affecting individual rights and interests. Investment tribunals should be more deferential in performing proportionality analysis, mindful of host state authorities’ greater democratic legitimacy and proximity to host state communities, and tribunals’ comparatively weak institutional capacity. Such an approach would entail greater deference to host states in evaluating the legitimacy of a measure’s objective, the measure’s suitability and necessity, and the ultimate balance between the interests of the host state and of the investor. An appropriately deferential use of proportionality analysis is a more coherent approach to indirect expropriation that provides greater space for host states to take measures in the public interest, yet provides sufficient scrutiny to control misuse of public power.", 22 March 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 223–255, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs012
8,‘Reasonable Period of Time’ in the WTO Dispute Settlement System,['MA Qian'],"This article provides a detailed examination of the problems existing in the determination of the reasonable period of time (RPT) in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system. It begins with a brief discussion on how the RPT is determined, both from the provisions of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) and from the WTO cases. Then, it analyzes various problems relevant to the RPT determination. What follows is an evaluation of the relevant reform proposals made by some WTO Members, on the basis of which the author puts forward his own suggestions. In particular, this article suggests that the current notification system be reformed to reduce the ‘black case work’, and that an interim relief system be introduced into the DSU. The author believes that only with the perfection of the retaliatory mechanism of the WTO dispute settlement system can the RPT mechanism best play its role of ensuring prompt compliance.", 28 February 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 257–285, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs005
9,Potential Accession to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement: A Case-Study on India,"['Sangeeta Khorana', ' Sujitha Subramanian']","The World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) is a voluntary plurilateral agreement applicable to WTO members that choose to be Parties to the Agreement. Most developing countries, including India, are not members of the GPA. This case study presents an insight into India’s current procurement framework, evaluates the prospects for, and comments on the principal constraints and challenges to India’s GPA accession. The findings suggest that, though the Indian procurement system is evolving and aims to align the regime with the GPA, there are considerable policy issues, capacity constraints, corruption and transparency failures in procurement practices that will need to be addressed before India can join the WTO GPA.", 21 February 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 1, March 2012, Pages 287–309, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs008
