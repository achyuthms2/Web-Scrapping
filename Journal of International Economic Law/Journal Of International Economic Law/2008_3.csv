0,NGO Involvement in the WTO: A Comparative Perspective,['Peter Van den Bossche'],"This article examines the nature and the extent of the involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the activities of the World Trade Organization (WTO). First, it looks at the arguments for and against NGO involvement in WTO activities. Next, the article discusses the legal basis for the involvement of NGOs in WTO activities and the various forms of involvement provided for. It compares the position of NGOs in the WTO with their position in other international organizations, in particular, the United Nations. Subsequently, the article explores the practice of WTO engagement with NGOs. Finally, it examines and compares the rules and procedures of the WTO and the United Nations for the selection of the NGOs with which to engage. This article concludes that a more open and engaged dialogue with civil society will make the WTO a more transparent and responsive organization, enjoying greater support among the general public in developed as well as developing country Members. Justified concerns about the legitimacy, accountability, and politics of NGOs could be eliminated, or at least mitigated, by introducing a system of accreditation in the WTO. While NGO involvement in the WTO definitely has its limits, the involvement of NGOs in other international organizations, in particular, the United Nations, suggests that these limits have not been reached as yet.", 18 October 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 717–749, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn032
1,Institutionalizing Public Participation in WTO Decision Making: Some Conceptual Hurdles and Avenues,['Yves Bonzon'],"This article assesses the potential of institutionalizing more structured mechanisms of public participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) decision making. It begins by developing a conceptual framework that distinguishes the four ‘implementation parameters’ of public participation: the goal, the object, the mechanisms, and the actors. Most proposals for more formalized public participation in the WTO view it as a way to mitigate an alleged legitimacy deficit in WTO decision making. This article questions the relevance of this goal. Turning to the object of participation, the article examines the institutional structure of the WTO and points to challenges in identifying those decisions, mostly pertaining to the elimination of nontariff barriers to trade, that should be opened to public participation. ‘Sensitive’ decisions are mostly reached by the dispute settlement bodies, sometimes by reference to rules adopted outside the institutional framework of the WTO. It is argued that the adoption processes of these external rules are a relevant object of public participation in the WTO context. Finally, administrative review of these adoption processes by the panels and Appellate Body as a mechanism to regulate public participation is considered.", 14 October 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 751–777, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn029
2,From the Periphery to the Center? The Evolving WTO Jurisprudence on Transparency and Good Governance,['Padideh Ala’i'],"The rise of the regulatory state in the latter half of the 20th century is reflected in the text of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements and specifically its transparency related obligations. The oldest transparency and good governance obligation of the WTO is Article X of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Article X imposes broad publication and due process requirements on the administration of measures in the area of trade in goods. The language of Article X is duplicated or incorporated by reference throughout the WTO Agreements. During the GATT years (1947–94), Article X was a silent provision dismissed by GATT panels as ‘subsidiary’ to the other ‘substantive’ provisions of the GATT. Since the creation of the WTO, Article X has emerged from obscurity, and is now viewed as creating obligations of ‘fundamental importance,’ such as transparency and due process. In addition, there has been an exponential increase in the number of cases asserting Article X claims before WTO panels and the Appellate Body. The resulting treatment of such claims by the WTO dispute settlement bodies reflects both the emerging role of the WTO as a supranational administrative body and the continuing discomfort of panels and the Appellate Body with applying good governance obligations.", 20 October 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 779–802, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn027
3,Selective Adaptation of WTO Transparency Norms and Local Practices in China and Japan,['Ljiljana Biukovic'],"This article focuses on the importance of Chinese and Japanese local practices, their regulatory infrastructure and local cultural norms related to transparency as factors in the selective adaptation of the World Trade Organization norms. International laws can acquire a variety of local meanings that require an understanding of the local history and culture in addition to knowledge of the local economy and laws. This article analyzes the selective adaptation paradigm, which allows for a determination of the extent to which noncompliance or less than full compliance can be attributed to the cultural particularities of states political factors such as the relationship between the central and local authorities. This article argues that a shift in perception of regulatory transparency norms in China and Japan has occurred, and that this shift has had important economic and political consequences internally and externally, which has brought about significant administrative law reforms and improved compliance with international norms.", 18 October 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 803–825, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn028
4,Judging Judges: From ‘Principal-Agent Theory’ to ‘Constitutional Justice’ in Multilevel ‘Judicial Governance’ of Economic Cooperation Among Citizens,['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"How should citizens evaluate the ever more important case law of international economic courts and their sometimes inadequate responses (e.g. by investor-state arbitration) to ‘the governance gaps created by globalization (which) provide the permissive environment for wrongful acts by companies of all kinds without adequate sanctioning or reparation’?1 Section I recalls that the customary law requirement (as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties) of settling ‘disputes concerning treaties, like other international disputes, … in conformity with the principles of justice and international law’, including ‘universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all’ (Preamble VCLT), reflects the constitutional functions of courts to interpret and apply law in conformity with ‘rule of law’, justice and human rights as constitutional restraints on the ‘rule of men’ and their ‘rule by law’. Section II explains why some of the governance problems of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are due to power-oriented conceptions of ‘principal-agent’ relationships as ‘member-driven governance’ without regard to the constitutional functions of WTO bodies to provide collective public goods with due respect for citizens as ‘democratic principals’. Sections III and IV recall how the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) Court developed diverse ‘constitutional methods’ of interpreting treaties among European states as ‘constitutional instruments’ protecting fundamental freedoms and social rights of European producers, investors, traders and consumers. Sections V and VI argue that the worldwide context of international economic law (IEL) differs from multilevel European constitutionalism and requires WTO and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) dispute settlement bodies and investor-state arbitral tribunals to exercise more judicial deference and respect for the diversity of constitutional principles in WTO Members and their regulatory discretion. Section VII concludes that national, regional and worldwide economic courts should promote common conceptions of rule of law and ‘constitutional justice’, following the ‘solange method’ of multilevel cooperation among national and international courts in Europe, in order to protect transnational ‘rule of law communities’ for mutually beneficial economic cooperation among citizens across frontiers.", 17 October 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 827–884, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn030
5,From ‘Direct Effect’ to ‘Muted Dialogue’: Recent Developments in the European Courts’ Case Law on the WTO and Beyond,['Marco Bronckers'],"Recent case law suggests that the European courts are rethinking their position in respect of international law. On the one hand, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is extending its case law on the WTO, denying ‘direct effect’ to all of its provisions, to other major international treaties, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In another recent judgment, the ECJ firmly said that it will not allow international agreements to jeopardize Europe's constitutional principles. These judgments might suggest that the ECJ is becoming more cautious, even skeptical toward international law. On the other hand, the WTO case law also illustrates that the ECJ has found more subtle ways than direct effect to give domestic law effect to international agreements. Examples are treaty-consistent interpretation, judicial dialogue with international tribunals, and transformation of international law into European legal principles. In this way, the ECJ is able to show respect to international law, which is indeed a core European value. At the same time, the ECJ maintains the power to act as a gatekeeper and resist those international legal norms that are considered inimical to the European legal order. On the whole the author welcomes this case law, albeit with some critical notes.", 04 November 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 885–898, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn037
6,Saving the WTO from the Risk of Irrelevance: The WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism as a ‘Common Good’ for RTA Disputes,"['Henry Gao', ' C. L. Lim']","Over the past few decades, Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) have proliferated globally. Such proliferation of RTAs created a renewed sense of urgency for the WTO to take action in order to avoid the fate of being eclipsed into irrelevance. There are several options for coping with the challenge. Theoretically speaking, the best approach would be to heighten the level of ambition in global trade talks to reduce all trade barriers to zero so that the discriminatory effect created by RTAs could be reduced or even eliminated. In reality, such an approach would be impossible for well-known reasons. The next best option would be for the WTO to draft ‘best practices’ or model RTAs to minimize the effect of further fragmentation created by different breeds of RTAs. The problems with this approach are first the resource constraints of the WTO, second the bounded rationality of human beings, and third, whether a ‘one size fits all’ approach would work. Yet another option offered is to strengthen the WTO's monitoring system of RTAs, with the 2006 rules on transparency being the most recent example. Unfortunately, as the Committee on RTAs (CRTAs), the main enforcer of the monitoring rules in the WTO, has been plagued with ineffectiveness because of the consensus rule, heightened monitoring rules would not be of much help either. In this article, we will discuss a fourth option, i.e. to use the WTO dispute settlement mechanism as a venue for resolving RTA disputes. The rationale underlying this initiative is that, by using the WTO dispute settlement system for RTA disputes, the Members will be able to develop a body of ‘common law’ on RTAs, which would then either form the basis of multilateral rules on RTAs or harmonize RTAs. This way, we can try to minimize the harmful effect of RTAs, and indeed turn RTAs from ‘stumbling blocks’ into ‘building blocks’ of the multilateral trading system.", 30 October 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 899–925, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn036
7,Rethinking TRIPS: ‘Adequate Remuneration’ for Non-voluntary Patent Licensing,['Antony Taubman'],"Driven by concerns about access to medicines, the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Declaration on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and Public Health and ensuing negotiations to amend the TRIPS Agreement, clarified and extended the international law governing compulsory licenses and government use for pharmaceutical patents. But this process left open the question of how to determine the ‘adequate remuneration’ payable when these measures are used. This article reviews this question in the light of guidance provided by the law and practice of WTO dispute settlement, and a broader legal and policy context, including the law of human rights and the law of investment. But this narrow issue also sheds light on the general character of WTO/TRIPS as a trade law regime within the broader context of international law. If the essential objective of trade law is to settle trade disputes guided by agreed standards on what constitutes a reasonable opportunity for legitimate competition, the law governing adequate remuneration for compulsory licensing shows how specific IP rules can be reconciled with trade law at the level of basic principle.", 18 November 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 927–970, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn035
8,Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond,['Kasturi Das'],"The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPSA) was negotiated with a view to setting in place an array of multilateral rules that would, on the one hand, recognize the legitimate right of WTO Members to adopt sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health, and on the other, enshrine certain checks and balances to cope with the possibility of these measures emerging as non-tariff barriers (NTBs). However, the experiences of developing countries including India with SPS requirements imposed particularly by the developed countries bear testimony to the fact that SPSA has thus far proved rather ineffective in living up to the latter objective. This is largely attributable to the fact that, its dual objective notwithstanding, SPSA has left considerable ‘space’ for WTO Members to use SPS measures for protectionist purposes under the guise of their ‘legitimate’ concerns. This ‘space’ seems to have been further reinforced by the mode of interpretation of SPSA by the WTO Dispute Settlement System. Written against this backdrop, the present article brings to the fore some of the key SPS challenges facing the developing countries by taking India as a case in point and explores certain plausible strategies to cope with such challenges in an effective manner.", 06 November 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 971–1019, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn033
9,Public Access to Dispute Settlement Hearings in the World Trade Organization,['Lothar Ehring'],"In 2005, the first dispute settlement panels of the World Trade Organization (WTO) decided that the public could observe their oral hearings. Following three years of panel practice with open hearings where both parties requested public access, the Appellate Body in 2008 followed suit and held its first open hearings. Most people had believed this to be impossible without modification of the WTO Agreement, and WTO Members were far apart regarding the desirability and legality of open hearings. This controversy persists, but it has changed considerably, based on the entirely successful experience of open hearings to date, which has already prompted several WTO Members to change their position. The new practice is a historic and irreversible shift from sixty years of Practice under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and in the WTO. It is also remarkable given the importance of allowing public observation of judicial hearings, as it exists across the world both domestically and internationally. More than a quarter of WTO disputes currently have public hearings, and the future practice is likely to consolidate the trend. No political fallout has occurred so far, as it did on amicus curiae in 2000. This is also unlikely to happen in the future, which will tell whether WTO Members can find agreement on codifying rules on transparency. Already now, justice is not only done at the WTO, but it can also be seen to be done.", 13 November 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 1021–1034, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn034
