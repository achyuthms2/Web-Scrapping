0,Mandatory and Discretionary Legislation: The Continued Relevance of the Distinction under the WTO,['Sharif Bhuiyan'],"There is a considerable body of GATT/WTO dispute settlement practice which stands for the principle that legislation mandating a violation of WTO obligations can be WTO‐incompatible, whereas legislation that merely gives the executive a discretion to violate those obligations cannot, by itself, be WTO‐incompatible. However, in US – Section 301 the Panel in effect held that under certain circumstances discretionary legislation can violate WTO obligations. As a result, considering the significance of the distinction between mandatory and discretionary legislation in the WTO context may be a useful exercise. This paper examines the GATT/WTO case law on mandatory/discretionary legislation and explains why discretionary legislation may sometimes be WTO‐inconsistent. It then discusses the implications of subjecting at least some discretionary laws to WTO discipline. However, requiring WTO‐consistency of all discretionary laws may not be realistic. Accordingly, the paper also explores ways in which panels may, where appropriate, defer to discretionary legislation of Members. It concludes by noting that the distinction will continue to be relevant under the WTO given that legislation mandating a WTO‐inconsistency will undoubtedly be regarded as WTO‐incompatible. However, the WTO‐compatibility of discretionary legislation will have to be addressed by the panels on a case‐by‐case basis.", 01 August 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 3, August 2002, Pages 571–604, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.3.571
1,Labour Law Beyond Borders,['Patrick Macklem'],"Flexible forms of transnational production and processes of economic globalization are increasingly challenging the traditional capacity of domestic labour law to promote justice in the world of work. At the same time, three international and transnational modes of regulation are forming beyond the state. First, the International Labour Organization is promoting a set of core labour rights with which all states ought to comply as a matter of international law. Secondly, numerous institutions and actors are linking international labour rights with trade liberalization initiatives. Thirdly, corporations are increasingly relying on codes of conduct to govern their employment relations. This paper argues that these developments are establishing relatively firm footholds in international law and operate in tandem to provide international legal authority for innovative domestic regulation of transnational corporate activity. Together with more general principles of international human rights law, they authorize a state to require all corporations operating within its jurisdiction and all corporations operating outside its jurisdiction seeking domestic market access to comply with a domestically enforceable code of conduct that enshrines international labour rights. Such a requirement should be contained in legislation that institutionalizes core features of modern legality and extends financial assistance to foreign communities adversely affected by corporate compliance.", 01 August 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 3, August 2002, Pages 605–645, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.3.605
2,Compliance and International Soft Law: Why Do Countries Implement the Basle Accord?,['Daniel E. Ho'],"This article presents empirical research into why countries comply with international soft law. I examine economic and institutional determinants of implementation of the 1988 Basle Accord on capital adequacy from a dataset of 107 countries. Market forces partially explain national decisions to implement the Basle Accord, lending support to the interpretation of international law as a reputational mechanism. One of the most striking and robust findings is the consistent positive effect of democratic systems on implementation, lending credence to democratic legalist theories of international law. Some evidence suggests that divided government and corruption are both negatively associated with soft law compliance. The findings also refute the explanation that countries ‘learned’ from prior banking crises, and support the contrary proposition that countries that experienced banking crises are in fact less likely to comply with international harmonization of banking regulation.", 01 August 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 3, August 2002, Pages 647–688, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.3.647
3,China Today: Why Its Accession to the World Trade Organization is Inevitable and Good for the International Community,['Edieth Y. Wu'],"This article develops China's progress over the last 25 years. Internal and external factors are analyzed to elucidate China's role in the international community. China's business policies and practices, relationship with Taiwan, domestic and international business practices, and changes in its political system that have affected its outward development are explored. External factors had a major impact on China's worldview; globalization concepts in relationships to transparency and trade practice norms are developed. New developments in domestic and international policies worked in tandem to impact China's decision to solidify its position in the international community. The international community was the catalyst for China's transformation, which will ultimately lead to its inevitable membership in the World Trade Organization. This article concludes that China deserves an opportunity to become an integral part of the international community, and that its economic potential is one of its greatest assets, which will benefit China as well as the global community.", 01 August 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 3, August 2002, Pages 689–718, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.3.689
4,Social Labelling and WTO Law,['Carlos Lopez‐Hurtado'],"This paper discusses the legality of government‐sponsored social labelling initiatives under the WTO agreements. It first presents the basic characteristics, potential and shortcomings of those initiatives and the drive towards government sponsorship as a way to correct the shortcomings. It then moves on to analyse these initiatives under the relevant GATT and TBT Agreement provisions. The article argues that regulatory measures that establish social labelling schemes may be analysed under Article III of GATT and also under the provisions of the TBT agreement. Although in certain circumstances those initiatives may be found inconsistent with those provisions, if such regulations rely on international standards, such as those agreed in the International Labour Organization, they may stand the best chance of being consistent with the substantive provisions of the agreements and/or the exception of GATT Article XX.", 01 August 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 3, August 2002, Pages 719–746, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.3.719
5,Can the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism Resolve Trade Disputes between China and Taiwan?,['Qingjiang Kong'],"Following China's accession to the WTO, Taiwan joined the trading body smoothly. This was believed to present a bright prospect for the trade relations between China and Taiwan, because, inter alia, the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism is supposed to facilitate and resolve trade disputes among members. However, the reality does not permit to unfold such a rosy picture. As illustrated by what both Beijing and Taipei have done since their accession, they seem unprepared to treat each other in a way as required by the WTO Agreement, which suggests prospective disputes across the Taiwan Straits. Moreover, the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism might be helpless or, at least, not as effective as it should be when it comes to the cross‐straits trade disputes. As Beijing and Taipei appear to be constantly obsessed with political concerns that override trade considerations, both parties are likely to politicize the use of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism at the cost of effectiveness as well as the credibility of the procedures. The international trade community should advisably help both Beijing and Taipei foster a common approach to the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism.", 01 August 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 3, August 2002, Pages 747–758, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.3.747
