0,International Law and the Settlement of Investment Disputes Relating To China,['Monika C. E. Heymann'],"This article examines how international investment law can be used to resolve investment disputes in China. After a general overview over the basic structure of international investment law, it explores the international legal rules applicable to foreign investors in China and Chinese investors in third countries. It focuses on China's obligations under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States; the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the WTO/GATT-regime and bilateral investment treaties. It thereby illustrates China's cautious approach to international arbitration and other international standards relating to the protection of foreign investors and the current trend in Chinese politics to turn to international law to protect its investors in third countries. The article concludes that—also caused by increasing Chinese outward investment—the international investment regime relating to China has left its infant stage and provides remedies for foreign investors in China and Chinese investors abroad.", 07 August 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 3, September 2008, Pages 507–526, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn023
1,A Theory of WTO Law,['Chios Carmody'],"The creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994 has left open the question of whether we can identify a theory of its legal system. A theory should help us to better understand what WTO law is as well as what it should be. This article posits the idea that a theory can be identified if we conceive of the WTO Agreement as protecting expectations about trade, facilitating adjustment to realities encountered in trade, and promoting interdependence. Each of these purposes is implemented under the WTO Agreement by a specific instrument. In the case of expectations it is collective obligations, in the case of realities it is individual rights, and in the case of interdependence it is a combination of the foregoing two, a lex specialis. The interaction is emblematic of a deeper division within the treaty between opposing modes of law.", 01 August 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 3, September 2008, Pages 527–557, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn017
2,New Trade Politics for the 21st Century,['Joost Pauwelyn'],"Once the Doha Round is concluded, or officially dead, the time will be ripe for a long term reflection on the future of the world trading system. The world has changed dramatically since the GATT's creation in 1947. Yet, 60 years later, the WTO has not adapted itself to these changes. Although commentators tend to focus on internal changes and reforms, most importantly are the external, real world changes that took place in the last 60 years. These changes range from historically low tariffs, an increased financial integration between countries, more diversification in world trade shares and proliferation of preferential trade agreements, to the unbundling of the production chain, the prevalence of unilateral trade liberalization, the emergence of new flanking policies and, crucially, a shift in the forces opposing free trade. These external shocks and changes are already leading to, and require, a ‘new trade politics’, both within countries and at the international level.", 10 July 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 3, September 2008, Pages 559–573, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn021
3,Non-State Global Standard Setting and the WTO: Legitimacy and the Need for Regulatory Space,"['Steven Bernstein', ' Erin Hannah']","The proliferation of transnational social and environmental standards developed by non-state governance systems potentially poses a challenge to international trade law and the legitimacy of the World Trade Organization (WTO). These systems—in areas including forestry, apparel, tourism, labour practices, agriculture, fisheries, and food—operate largely independently of states as well as of traditional standard setting bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization. In lieu of definitive legal rules on recognition of legitimate international standards under relevant trade agreements [e.g, Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS)], we identify the legal and political dynamics of standards recognition and find good prospects for these new non-state governance systems to successfully navigate them. Since these systems’ standards ultimately aim to socially embed global markets, the WTO's legitimacy is at risk if its rules open the door to legal challenges of states that implicitly or explicitly adopt them. To avoid such legitimacy problems, we propose that a norm of leaving ‘transnational regulatory space’ for social and environmental standard setting should guide the WTO and its members.", 19 July 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 3, September 2008, Pages 575–608, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn022
4,Testing European Prudential Conditions for Banking Mergers in the Light of Most Favoured Nation in the Gats,['Bart De Meester'],"This contribution examines how European conditions for takeovers of a European credit institution by a non-European credit institution may be assessed under the principle of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The article considers that violations are not unimaginable since current WTO case-law on ‘likeness’ insufficiently takes into account the risks that are linked to different prudential frameworks in which banks operate. However, a differentiation among banks from different trading partners through decisions on the ‘equivalence’ of consolidated supervision by certain non-European authorities with European supervision, may be saved under the GATS provisions on recognition. Nonetheless, lack of transparency in these decisions may remain problematic. Even if the prudential carve-out provides a broad exception for prudential measures, it may not necessarily justify this deficiency. The article illustrates how the European rules comply with GATS requirements and how consistency could further be ensured. It is shown that international prudential standards may play an important role in the interpretation of these provisions. The article argues that the GATS-scrutiny as well as the importance of international standards requires the European Union to intensify its efforts on international standard-setting.", 09 July 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 3, September 2008, Pages 609–647, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn020
5,Privatization and The Definition of Subsidy: A Critical Study of Appellate Body Texturalism,['Richard Diamond'],"Analysis of the Appellate Body's (AB) treatment of a particular legal question often provides insight into issues of more general importance. In this article, examination of the AB's treatment of a particular subsidy issue is used to explore the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures’ (SCM Agreement) definition of subsidy and to question the efficacy of the AB's reliance on texturalism. The legal question analyzed arose when European governments challenged the US's imposition of countervailing duties (CVDs) on steel manufactured by ‘privatized’ steel companies. The US claimed the CVDs were proper since subsidies provided prior to privatization had ‘passed through’ to the privatized companies. The AB, relying heavily on the meaning of words rather than on consideration of ‘object and purpose’, found that the US had violated its obligations under the SCM Agreement. An analysis of the AB's logic and the authorities cited demonstrates that neither justifies the AB's conclusion. A heuristic model of the definition of subsidy is used to show that the question raised by privatization implicates issues of causation, overlooked by the AB, that are important in correctly interpreting the SCM Agreement. The problems arising from AB texturalism are contrasted with the justifications given for that approach, suggesting that a change in approach may be warranted.", 13 August 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 3, September 2008, Pages 649–678, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn026
6,Climate Change and the Generalized System of Preferences,['Michael McKenzie'],"The possibility of using (and misusing) trade measures to address the problems of climate change has long been recognized. Yet, only recently, with the intensification of climate change policy making, has the interface between international trade law and the issue of climate change begun to garner attention. Most analysis has concentrated on how climate change policy may subvert international trade rules. This article focuses on the potential for incorporating trade liberalization into climate change policy. Specifically, it explores how the Generalized System of Preferences, a flexible mechanism for opening markets to developing countries, could be used to engage developing countries in efforts to combat climate change.", 06 August 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 11, Issue 3, September 2008, Pages 679–695, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn024
