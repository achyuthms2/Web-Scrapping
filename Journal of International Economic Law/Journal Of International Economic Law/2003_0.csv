0,Trade and Competition in the WTO: Pondering the Applicability of Special and Differential Treatment,['Hunter Nottage'],"This article critically evaluates the potential applicability of special and differential treatment (‘S&D’) as a mechanism for addressing development concerns often associated with a possible WTO agreement on trade and competition policy. It begins by examining the origins, evolution, and current S&D provisions in the GATT and WTO. It then addresses S&D in a trade and competition context, by first evaluating its broad relevance and then exploring a number of options to formulate the concept in order to most effectively advance development objectives in this nascent area. While the article advocates that S&D could play a valuable role in addressing the special challenges faced by developing countries at this policy interface, it highlights where opinions differ, or empirical evidence is lacking, on the true developmental value of the various options explored. This is particularly the case concerning exceptions and exemptions, to competition regimes, the role of transitional time periods, and the optimal phasing in of competition policy. Thus the article argues that in a trade and competition policy context S&D is not a panacea, and cautions against S&D being used to delay or exempt the introduction of competition disciplines, where such disciplines would be of benefit to developing countries.", 01 March 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 1, March 2003, Pages 23–47, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.1.23
1,Regional Economic Integration in East Asia: Prospect and Jurisprudence,['Won‐Mog Choi'],"There has been a veritable explosion of regional trade agreements (‘RTAs’) in the last 15 years or so. Nearly every country in the world became a member of one or more RTAs. The exception was Northeast Asia. But, as China, Japan, and Korea move toward regionalism, discarding their single‐track approach, the East Asian region is expected to become a web of multiple RTAs in the upcoming decade. The WTO Agreement establishes certain rules for regionalism that help realize the ‘building bloc’ idea. These rules can be summarized as the external, internal, and procedural requirement. It is true that some of these requirements are quite vaguely expressed and that application of these rules has been loose. As a result, de facto ignorance of GATT discipline and the phenomenon of the spread of ‘partial’ RTAs have developed. Hence, in order for regionalism to play a truly complementary role for multilateralism, those rules ought to be clarified and observed. It should not be forgotten that the main beneficiary of WTO‐consistent integration in East Asia would be none other than the East Asians themselves. The East Asian countries must bear this in mind during the integration process.", 01 March 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 1, March 2003, Pages 49–77, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.1.49
2,Cross‐Border Bank Insolvency: Legal Implications in the Case of Banks Operating in Different Jurisdictions in Latin America,['Rosa Maria Lastra'],"This article focuses on the issue of bank liquidation from an international perspective and discusses the legal implications of the liquidation of banks with branches and subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. The regional scope of the paper is Latin America, though references to EU and US law are also ncluded. The paper is divided into five sections, beginning with an introduction to the subject. Section I broadly discusses the options available to the authorities to deal with failed banks (liquidation or rehabilitation). Section II deals with the international, regional, and bilateral rules regarding issues of cross‐border insolvency. Special attention is given to the Montevideo Treaties and the Bustamante Conventions as relevant treaty developments in this field in Latin America. This section also covers a brief analysis of international law principles applicable to cross‐border insolvency. Section III examines the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision with regard to the international regulation of branches and subsidiaries. It also presents some observations with regard to the closure of a multinational bank. Section IV surveys the regulation of branches, subsidiaries, and joint ventures in some Latin American countries. This Section is complemented by three appendixes at the end of the paper which summarize the legislation applicable to foreign branches and subsidiaries and to local branches and subsidiaries overseas in six jurisdictions: Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, and Argentina. A further appendix (Appendix 4) analyses the powers of supervisors, in particular with regard to the liquidation of banks, in these six jurisdictions. Section V presents the example of the Brazilian normative and practice to deal with the problems (including possible liquidation) of foreign branches and subsidiaries in the country as well as the problems (including possible liquidation) of branches and subsidiaries abroad. The latter is illustrated by a case which involved the liquidation of a Brazilian bank with branches in New York and Cayman Islands.", 01 March 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 1, March 2003, Pages 79–110, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.1.79
3,Panel Selection in WTO Dispute Settlement Proceedings,['Andrew W. Shoyer'],"If perception is reality, it is never more so than in the process in which WTO Members and the WTO Secretariat engage when selecting panelists to serve in dispute settlement proceedings. In the excellent paper that appears elsewhere in this volume, Professor Davey makes the case for a WTO permanent panel body. But, as the nursemaid Buttercup observes (rather defensively, as the plot of Pinafore develops), appearances can be deceiving. And notwithstanding the flaws fairly noted by Professor Davey, the flexibility of the current ad hoc selection system serves to address one of the key objectives of a party to a WTO panel proceeding – to compose a panel that appears likely to rule in its favor – better than would a permanent panel body. Although they may reform certain elements of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism as part of the Doha Development Agenda, Members should not be expected to discard this flexibility (what Professor Davey refers to as ‘party control’) easily. Panel composition under current procedures is a high‐stakes game that, when played well, can benefit both sides of the dispute and the overall WTO system. What follows is a brief examination of the current practice, and a discussion of the case for preserving the flexibility of the current ad hoc system.", 01 March 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 1, March 2003, Pages 203–209, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.1.203
4,Comment on a WTO Permanent Panel Body,['Jacques H.J. Bourgeois'],"The task of commenting usefully on Professor Davey's ‘The Case for a WTO Permanent Panel Body’ is not an easy one. He speaks with the authority of one that, in his former capacity of Director of the WTO Legal Affairs Division, has in fact had a major role in selecting panelists as a result of the frequent failure of parties to agree on a slate of panelists, and has followed closely on the ground the functioning of panels under the new WTO dispute settlement system. Moreover, a commentator is expected to disagree so as to provoke a debate. This commentator happens to share Professor Davey's overall assessment that the permanent panel body proposal does have sufficient benefits to make it worth going forward. So, these comments are ‘concurring’ rather than ‘dissenting’. I will deal first with the potential advantages and then with the potential disadvantages, ending with a brief concluding remark.", 01 March 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 1, March 2003, Pages 211–235, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.1.211
5,WTO Negotiators Meet Academics: The Negotiations on Improvements of the WTO Dispute Settlement System,['Ernst‐Ulrich Petersmann'],"On 13–14 September 2002, the European University Institute in Florence sponsored – thanks to the financial support from British Petroleum (BP) – an international workshop on the current negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO) on improvements and clarifications of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). The negotiating proposals submitted so far to the DSB in Special Session can be grouped into eight different categories. This short conference report, written by the workshop organizer, begins with a brief introduction to the importance of the law of international organizations for improving the political and legal methods for the international prevention and settlement of disputes. Subsequently, the report summarizes the arguments made during the discussions on the various negotiating proposals, yet without summarizing the eight published conference reports and without disclosing the identity of WTO negotiators in order to respect the fact that their statements were made on a personal basis.", 01 March 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 1, March 2003, Pages 237–250, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.1.237
