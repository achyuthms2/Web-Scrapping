0,China's Accession to the WTO: The Services Dimension,['Aaditya Mattoo'],"China's GATS commitments represent the most radical services reform program negotiated in the WTO. China has promised to eliminate over the next few years most restrictions on foreign entry and ownership, as well as most forms of discrimination against foreign firms. In general, these commitments promote good policy. But the persistence of restrictions on foreign ownership (temporary in most sectors but more durable in telecommunications and life insurance) may dampen the incentives for foreign investors to improve firm performance. And initial restrictions on the geographical scope of services liberalization could encourage the further agglomeration of economic activity in certain regions – to an extent that is unlikely to be reversed completely by subsequent country‐wide liberalization. Finally, realizing the gains from, and perhaps even the sustainability of, liberalization will require significant improvements in the regulatory framework and the appropriate sequencing of reforms.", 01 June 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 2, June 2003, Pages 299–339, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.2.299
1,Public Services and Trade Liberalization: Mapping the Legal Framework,['Markus Krajewski'],"The impact of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) on public services is subject to a vivid political debate. From a legal perspective, an important issue is the sectoral scope of the GATS and the exact meaning of the term ‘services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority’ in Article I:3(b) GATS. This paper shows that this provision is likely to be interpreted narrowly and that most public services will fall within the sectoral scope of GATS. The reason for this finding lies in the definition of governmental services, which emphasizes the non‐commercial basis and non‐competitive supply of a service. This definition distinguishes GATS law from the similar provision in Article 45 EC. WTO Members wishing to reduce the impact of GATS on public services can do so through their schedules of specific commitments or seek an interpretation of the GATS, which would give them more regulatory flexibility.", 01 June 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 2, June 2003, Pages 341–367, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.2.341
2,When the Peace Ends: The Vulnerability of EC and US Agricultural Subsidies to WTO Legal Challenge,"['Richard H. Steinberg', ' Timothy E. Josling']","Article 13 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, known as the ‘Peace Clause’, precludes most WTO dispute settlement challenges against a country that is complying with the Agreement's liberalization commitments – until 1 January 2004, when the Peace Clause will expire. This article evaluates the strength of the main legal theories likely to be used in challenges to EC and US agricultural subsidies after expiry of the Peace Clause, and then employs economic techniques (regression analysis and equilibrium modeling) to meaningfully apply the soundest legal theories to economic data about agriculture trade. We conclude that when the Peace Clause expires, many commodity‐specific EC and US agricultural subsidies will be vulnerable to legal challenge under Articles 6.3(a)–(c) and 6.4 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The remedy would require that such subsidies be withdrawn or that appropriate steps be taken to remove their adverse effects. Non‐subsidizing developing countries can be expected to bargain in the shadow of this legal vulnerability, demanding that the Community and the United States commit to further subsidy reductions and a shift toward tariffs‐and‐decoupled‐payments systems, in exchange for extension of the Peace Clause.", 01 June 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 2, June 2003, Pages 369–417, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.2.369
3,Environmentally Motivated Tax Distinctions and WTO Law: The European Commission's Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy in Light of the ‘Like Product‐’ and ‘PPM‐’ Debates,"['Reinhard Quick', ' Christian Lau']","The article discusses the WTO‐compatibility of a reduced VAT rate for ‘environmentally friendly’ products as proposed in the European Commission's Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy. It analyses certain hypothetical cases in the light of GATT Articles III and XX and the corresponding WTO jurisprudence. Furthermore, the article elaborates on the issues of ‘like products’, ‘PPMs’ and the question whether identical products can, nevertheless, be considered ‘unlike’. Concerning the GATT Article XX justifications the article develops the distinction of discriminatory effect, for example a GATT Article III violation, and discriminatory intent which precludes justifications under GATT Article XX. Finally, it discusses the criticism raised in the literature of the Appellate Body's approach to GATT Article III and XX as improperly limiting the regulatory autonomy of WTO Members. The article concludes that the careful approach chosen by the Appellate Body leaves sufficient scope for WTO Members to address public policy concerns and does not expose this young legal institution to severe institutional criticism. Alternative approaches proposed in the literature lack a textual basis in GATT 1994, add to or diminish the rights and obligations of WTO Members under GATT Article XX, and would expose the Appellate Body to criticism of making instead of interpreting the law.", 01 June 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 2, June 2003, Pages 419–458, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.2.419
4,Toward Open Recognition? Standardization and Regional Integration under Article XXIV of GATT,['Joel P. Trachtman'],"This article provides a legal analysis of the significance of standards, technical regulations, and sanitary or phytosanitary (SPS) provisions (collectively, ‘TBTSPS’ provisions) in regional trade agreements (‘RTAs’) in relation to the multilateral trading system. It first examines the ways in which RTA regulation of national TBTSPS measures may contribute to or detract from liberalization goals. It then describes how GATT Article XXIV and the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXIV (the ‘Understanding’), as presently understood, regulate RTA regulation of national TBTSPS measures. Based on its analysis, this article makes the following recommendations: (1) Interpret Article XXIV:5 of GATT to provide an exception from obligations contained in the TBT Agreement and SPS Agreement, principally the MFN obligation, in accordance with the Turkey – Textiles necessity test. This avoids imposing an inappropriate barrier to formation of RTAs. (2) Interpret ‘other restrictive regulations of commerce’ and ‘other regulations of commerce’ in Articles XXIV:5 and 8 to include only discriminatory and unnecessary TBT or SPS measures. This avoids requirements to eliminate or harmonize non‐protectionist TBT or SPS measures. It avoids imposing an inappropriate barrier to formation of RTAs. (3) Interpret Article I:1 of GATT and the MFN provisions of the TBT Agreement and SPS Agreement to clarify authorization for only ‘open’ mutual recognition agreements, similar to the permission contained in Article VII of GATS. This ensures that recognition arrangements will not provide an avenue of discrimination or other defection from WTO multilateral free trade principles. Today, it is not clear that any mutual recognition agreements are authorized.", 01 June 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 2, June 2003, Pages 459–492, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.2.459
5,The Use of Investor–State Arbitration under Bilateral Investment Treaties to Seek Relief for Breaches of WTO Law,['Gaetan Verhoosel'],"This contribution advances the proposition that the development of a global network of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) may increasingly offer foreign investors an opportunity directly to challenge breaches of WTO law and to seek relief in the form of cessation of the WTO‐inconsistent measure and, when the measure can be shown to have proximately caused them injury, damages. Measures affecting intra‐firm trade, the investments of foreign service suppliers, or the rights of intellectual property rights holders may, in certain circumstances, constitute breaches of a host State's obligations under both the WTO Agreement and the applicable BIT. When a foreign investor initiates investor – State arbitration under the applicable BIT to seek withdrawal of and/or damages for such measures, WTO law may arguably come into play in two – formally – distinct manners. First, WTO law may be applicable to the investment dispute. Second, WTO law may in any event provide important interpretative context for the regulatory treatment obligations of the BIT. In either case, the strongly held precept that private entities cannot directly invoke WTO law in the state courts of WTO Members and claim monetary damages for breaches of WTO law, cannot be replicated to BIT arbitrations without further qualification.", 01 June 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 2, June 2003, Pages 493–506, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.2.493
6,The WTO Enabling Clause and Positive Conditionality in the European Community's GSP Program,['Lorand Bartels'],"Like virtually all developed countries, the European Community grants special trade preferences to developing countries by way of a generalized scheme of preferences, known as a GSP program. In addition, the EC operates a rewards‐based system of ‘special incentive arrangements’, according to which developing countries may apply for further preferences if they can demonstrate compliance with specified environmental and labour standards. This article assesses this system of positive conditionality in light of WTO rules. It begins with an outline of the EC's GSP program and a discussion of the relevant governing instruments, in particular the 1971 GSP Decision and the 1979 Enabling Clause. It then discusses certain systemic issues, such as the implications of the fact that GSP preferences are granted on a voluntary basis, and the present legal status of the Enabling Clause. The article next addresses the substantive question whether the description of trade preferences as ‘generalized, non‐reciprocal and non‐discriminatory’ in the GSP Decision represents a condition of their legality under the Enabling Clause. The final section of this article analyses the meaning of these terms, with special reference to their drafting history, and presents a view on the legality of the EC's system of positive conditionality.", 01 June 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 2, June 2003, Pages 507–532, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.2.507
