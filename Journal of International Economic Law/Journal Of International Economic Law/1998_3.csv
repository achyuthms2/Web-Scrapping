0,Editorial. The enduring enigma of TRIPS: a challenge for the world economic system,['FM Abbott'],"This special issue on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) is introduced with a perspective that focuses on the urgency of narrowing the gap in living standards between the rich nations and the poor. The 1997/98 world economic crisis highlights the question of whether creating an international market in intellectual property sufficiently addresses the interests of developing countries in the diffusion and use of knowledge. It is suggested that substantial intervention by international institutions with interests in promoting development is also required. The role of IPRs in economic development is analyzed, and this contribution points to a few areas in which consensus among international IPRs specialists is emerging. Among these is that the role of IPRs is context-sensitive, depending on the particular characteristics of countries in which IPRs systems are introduced, and depending on the specific industries in which these IPRs are employed. This context-sensitive role argues for flexible implementation of the TRIPS Agreement in developing and newly industrializing countries. In WTO implementation of the TRIPS Agreement (including a review of national laws and dispute settlement) and in forthcoming WTO TRIPS negotiations (in areas such as biotechnology and genetics, the digital environment and electronic commerce, exhaustion of rights, non-violation causes of actions, competition and investment), the specific interests of the developing countries must be given a priority. Just as developed countries have traditionally balanced the IPRs interests of producers, consumers, and the science and research communities, so also must the WTO balance respective global interests in technology and creativity. The author urges a more extensive role for institutions such as the World Bank in technology capacity-building.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 497–521, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.497
1,Implementation of the TRIPS agreement and prospects for its further development,['A Otten'],"WTO Members can look back on the first three and a half years of the TRIPS Agreement with some satisfaction. Implementation by developed countries has been broadly satisfactory, although not without its gaps and delays. The TRIPS Council has developed and run-in important mechanisms for monitoring compliance. The dispute settlement mechanism has, in general, worked well and has already yielded positive results in the TRIPS area. A huge amount has been done by developing countries in anticipation of the end of their transition periods. Cooperation with WIPO has been established and is going well. Some useful work has been done on the built-in agenda.
However, the principal challenges probably remain for the future. Much still has to be done by developing countries to bring themselves into compliance. The mechanisms of the WTO, in particular the TRIPS Council and the dispute settlement system, have to show that they have the capacity to deal with compliance issues arising from implementation by more than 130 Members as opposed to the 30 plus countries so far. As for the further development of the Agreement, the coming period leading to the possible launching of broad-based negotiations, in the WTO at the end of 1999 will be a critical period for reflection and consensus-building on the way in which the TRIPS Agreement should evolve in the future.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 523–536, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.523
2,Reforming intellectual property rights regimes: challenges for developing countries,"['CA Primo Braga', ' C Fink']","This paper describes changes to the environment in which developing countries make decisions with respect to IPRs, including changes brought about by the intensification of world trade in technology-dependent goods and services, and changes brought about by the evolution of technologies. It is suggested that innovation has become a more important factor for developing country economies, and that the enhancement of IPRs-related infrastructure has therefore taken on added significance for these economies, IPRs-related infrastructures that are best suited to developing country economies may be different to those that are best suited to industrialized country economies, and the authors offer a number of strategic options for developing countries. International institutions such as the World Bank may play an important role in enhancing the capacity of developing countries to take advantage of innovative activity in the industrialized countries, as well in promoting local innovation. These institutions may play the role of honest broker among countries and groups with different technology-related interests, they may create training programs for technical administrative personnel and judges, they may facilitate improvements in educational institutions that encourage innovative activity, and they may also take a lead role in advanced research on the role of IPRs in international economic development.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 537–554, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.537
3,The protection of genetic resources and traditional knowledge: towards more specific rights and obligations in world trade law,['T Cottier'],"This article looks at intellectual property rights (IPRs) issues relevant to the past and the future: the exploitation of genetic and other biological resources. As genetic resources are becoming more scarce as a consequence of environmental degradation, and as industry is investing large sums to create new products based on these resources, the allocation of rights in them is of compelling interest. It is possible to draw close analogies both to traditional international and national law concepts of property allocation with respect to tangible natural resources and real and personal property, as well as to traditional concepts of intellectual property rights, but neither of the existing models should be used directly to address genetic resources. The granting of Traditional Intellectual Property Rights (TIP-Rights) would encourage the preservation of traditional knowledge; however, there are several obstacles to developing a system designed to protect such knowledge. A system of registration that does not require pre-grant examination may be the best alternative; rights should also not be limited to indigenous peoples or other groups, but rather should be available to all individuals and communities holding traditional knowledge. The importance to developed and developing countries of genetic resources and traditional knowledge requires that issues concerning their allocations and protection be brought into the WTO for resolution in the context of a Millennium Round.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 555–584, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.555
4,Securing compliance with the TRIPS agreement after US v India,['JH Reichman'],"The different developmental circumstances of the industrialized and developing countries call for different approaches to intellectual property rights protection. While increasingly high levels of protection may (or may not) be appropriate to the industrialized economies, developing country economies are more likely to benefit from strategies and rules which encourage building upon existing stocks of knowledge. TRIPS Agreement standards provide sufficient 'wiggle room' to allow developing countries to pursue pro-competitive strategies, while still acting consistently with the TRIPS Agreement requirements of national and most favoured nation treatment. The decision of the WTO Appellate Body in the India-Mailbox case was a critical step in affirming the WTO-consistency of pursuing national and regional policies which take advantage of the absence of strict harmonization of IPRs standards at the worldwide level. The India-Mailbox decision suggests that the WTO will accord substantial deference to national and regional rules which manifest good faith compliance with the basic standards of the TRIPS Agreement. Developing countries that adopt pro-competitive IPRs-related strategies may move faster along the technology curve than countries that follow more protectionist strategies.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 585–601, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.585
5,Intellectual property,['Lord Sydney Templeman'],"Prior to his appointment to the UK House of Lords as a Law Lord, Lord Templeman authored a seminal opinion on exhaustion of rights and parallel importation in the field of trademarks: Revlon v Cripps & Lee. This paper reflects on the nature of the rights characterized as 'intellectual property'. It is argued that the term 'intellectual property' is a pernicious fiction because it acts to disguise the creation and enforcement of monopolies which are contrary to the public interest. A number of specific recommendations are made to minimize the injurious effects of these monopolies. These include: adopting a more receptive attitude toward compulsory licensing; examining the books of patent holders, including pharmaceutical companies, to determine how monopoly profits are being spent; increasing attention to the impact of the TRIPS Agreement on developing countries; and, recognizing a universal doctrine of exhaustion of rights.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 603–606, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.603
6,First Report (final) to the Committee on International Trade Law of the International Law Association on the subject of parallel importation,['FM Abbott'],"The First Report on Parallel Imports approaches the exhaustion/parallel imports question in broad economic terms, asking whether there may be an economic and social welfare benefit to permitting IPRs holders to block parallel imports that outweighs the potential harm to liberal trade. The Report addresses each major form of IPR (patent, trademark and copyright) separately. It concludes with respect to each form that the evidence of benefits that might flow from allowing parallel imports to be blocked is insufficient to justify the potential inhibition of trade. The Report observes that most objectives which IPRs holders seek to achieve by the allocation of geographic markets can be attained through less trade restrictive means, namely through the vertical allocation of distribution territories by contract. The interests of the developing countries are a focus of the Report. Some economists have suggested that allowing rules on parallel information to enforce price discrimination in favor of developing countries may increase global economic welfare. The Report concludes that developing and developed countries are better served by open markets and the operation of comparative advantage. The Report recommends that the WTO adopt a rule precluding governments from blocking parallel imports save in certain exceptional cases, and it also suggests that further study of this issue would be desirable.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 607–636, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.607
7,The conflicts between parallel trade and product access and innovation: the case of pharmaceuticals,"['HE Bale', ' Jr']","In this paper, the case is laid out for restricting parallel trade in products protected by intellectual property rights, and pharmaceuticals in particular. The paper responds to three arguments made in favor of open parallel trade by its proponents, focusing on F. Abbott's First Report (Final) on the Subject of Parallel Importation, [Journal of International Economic Law 1, 607-636]. First, it is argued that in the case of patented products with high fixed costs (e.g., pharmaceuticals), parallel trade may decrease global economic welfare. Attention is drawn to price controls within the EU member states as a distortion which is inconsistent with open market principles, yet not adequately accounted for by EU regulatory organs in the context of its intra-Union exhaustion rules. It is also suggested that rules restricting parallel trade are a necessary corollary to pharmaceutical price discrimination in favor of developing countries, which practice discrimination is advocated by international institutions such as the World Health Organization. Finally, the paper indicates that restrictions on parallel trade in the pharmaceutical sector are necessary to protect the public against risks arising from inadequate supervision of the secondary market, such as risks from inappropriate repackaging and inadequate storage and handling procedures, and counterfeit products.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 637–653, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.637
8,The interface between competition policy and intellectual property in the context of the international trading system,['RD Anderson'],"The author reflects on the relationship between intellectual property rights and competition law. The emergence of a new prospective among economists on this relationship is stressed, suggesting that a dynamic view of the role of IPRs in promoting economic welfare gains generally leads to the conclusion that IP protection is compatible with economic principles favoring competitive markets. The current attitude of competition law authorities toward IPRs in Canada, the European Union, Japan and the USA is described. This attitude reflects a shift away from a more critical approach to IPRs followed by competition authorities in the 1970s. It is postulated that these authorities have accepted a new dynamic view of the economic role of IPRs. The rules of the WTO TRIPS Agreement which address anti-competitive practices are also described. The circumstances in which IPRs may nevertheless facilitate economic outcomes adverse to public welfare are considered. There are certain market segments (e.g., the network environment) in which risks of abuse may be greater than in others. Also, there are risks that overprotection may lead to suboptimal economic outcomes. The exhaustion of rights/parallel imports question is touched on briefly, suggesting that it may not be practicable to extend the EU role of exhaustion to the multilateral arena, but also suggesting that regional rules of exhaustion may be useful.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 655–678, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.655
9,European court rules on TRIPS agreement,['GA Desmedt'],"In a judgment of 16 June 1998, the Court of Justice of the European Communities gave a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of a TRIPS provision following a referral by a Dutch Judge. The judgment was highly anticipated, as it was the first time that the Court pronounced upon the substance of the TRIPS agreement. Furthermore, the case gave rise to a lengthy debate on the direct effect of TRIPS provisions and on the question whether the Court of Justice was competent to interpret the TRIPS agreement", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 679–682, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.679
10,The WTO dispute settlement mechanism and Japanese traders,['H Yamane'],"The first issue of Journal of International Economic Law examined how private parties in the USA and the EU convince their governments to act on their behalf by bringing a case about foreign trade barriers to the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. In the USA, S. 301 of the Trade Ace offers such an avenue and grants the USTR authority to implement sanctions authorized by the WTO. In the EU, the Trade Barriers Regulation was instituted primarily to provide the Community with a procedure to respond to complaints by private parties alleging 'obstacles to trade', i.e. 'any trade practice adopted or maintained by a third country in respect of which international trade rules establish a right of action'. In order to gain another perspective, this article will examine private enforcement of international trade rules in Japan.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 683–690, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.683
11,Customs Tariff S. 59(2): a 'Canadian 301'?,['C Carmody'],"It is sometimes said that every country has a S. 301, and Canada is no exception. Section 59(2) of Canada's Customs Tariff allows the Canadian government to take a broad range of measures against foreign goods and services in order to enforce Canada's rights under a trade agreement or to counter discriminatory foreign practices with an adverse effect on Canada's trade. The provision is clearly retaliatory in nature. Here, however, the similarities with S. 301 end. Canada's unilateral trade remedy may indeed by 301-like, but the conditions under which it exists are fundamentally distinct. A comparison of the two statutes helps to illustrate the difference. At the same time Canada has never seen unilateral retaliation as particularly useful, so that any discussion of S. 59(2) and its related legislation must concentrate more on theory than reality.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 690–694, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.690
12,Hormones: 'objective assessment' and (or as) standard of review,['GS Desmedt'],"In the Appellate Body report on EC measures affecting meat and meat products, commonly referred to as the Hormones case, some of the findings of the Appellate Body related to the appropriate standard of review that panels must observe when evaluating the legality of a WTO member state measure that is in dispute. As this was the first Appellate Body ruling on the issue of standard of review, it could be an important indicator of the approach panels may take in the future to this issue.", 01 December 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 4, December 1998, Pages 695–698, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.4.695
