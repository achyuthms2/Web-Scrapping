0,The Scales of Trade—Reflections on the Growth and Functions of the WTO Adjudicative Branch,['Piet Eeckhout'],"This essay argues that, increasingly, international economic law develops through adjudication. It therefore aims to offer some reflections on the growth and functions of the WTO adjudicative branch, which is of central importance to international economic law, by reviewing a number of important developments in the case law. The essay shows that important policy questions are submitted to adjudication. It aims to identify some of those questions, and to establish some parameters for WTO adjudication. It focuses in particular on the case law concerning the GATT and GATS General Exceptions, which, notwithstanding their generality and indeterminacy, occupy a central position in the resolution of international trade disputes. The essay takes issue with the use of economic concepts such as cost-effectiveness and cost–benefit balancing to characterize the adjudicative process of applying the General Exceptions. It argues that these concepts are inappropriate for analysing questions about trade versus environment/health/morals, etc. Instead, the essay suggests that legal theory offers further guidance for developing tools aimed at limiting adjudicative discretion. The essay approves of the weighing-and-balancing test which the Appellate Body has introduced, and contends that there is now a richer toolkit for tackling these sensitive cases and questions.", 25 March 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 1, March 2010, Pages 3–26, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq006
1,The Global Financial Crisis and Government Support for Banks: What Role for the Gats?,['Bart De Meester'],"This article examines whether the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is a useful instrument to tackle government support that creates distortions of international competition in the banking sector. The GATS has no specific provisions on subsidies. However, general support schemes ‘as such’ or ‘as applied’ may violate Article XVII if they exclude foreign-owned banks with a commercial presence in the territory of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Member that adopts the scheme. This depends on the specific commitments of the WTO Member and the limitations to this commitment. Moreover, it is required that the excluded banks are ‘like’ the domestic banks. A single application of a general scheme may violate Article VI(1) if solid evidence is available that this application is not reasonable, objective or impartial. Despite these possible violations, the great majority of measures will still be justified under the broad ‘prudential carve-out’. Only support measures that are not reasonably able to achieve the prudential goal will not be exempted. Hence, the GATS imposes restraint on government support only in very limited cases. The WTO Members should address the remaining uncertainties with regard to both the obligations and the exception. This would ensure that the GATS is able to prevent that government support distorts competition and would also alleviate concerns that the GATS constitutes a danger to financial stability.", 25 March 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 1, March 2010, Pages 27–63, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq004
2,Redesigning the Negotiation Process at the WTO,['Sonia E. Rolland'],"The negotiation structure at the World Trade Organization (WTO) primarily relies on the single undertaking, an all or nothing approach that typically precludes separate agreements among some of the parties or on some of the agenda items. This article argues for a re-examination of the value of the single undertaking, particularly with reference to developing country Members. With respect to the substantive negotiations, ‘linkage’ (the inter-dependent regulation of trade and other fields that are deemed to have an impact on trade) has been a powerful principle for the expansion of WTO regulation and the single undertaking has, so far, served as the vector to implement linkage. As a counterpoint, this article argues that linkage can—and should be—decoupled from negotiation design, particularly from the unquestioned and systematic recourse to the single undertaking. The article offers avenues for redesigning negotiations beyond the old dichotomy of the single undertaking versus ‘à-la-carte’ approaches. It proposes alternative negotiation structures that take into account the practical realities of many WTO Members with limited institutional capacity as well as the desirability for some Members to liberalize trade at a faster pace.", 08 February 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 1, March 2010, Pages 65–110, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp045
3,Defragmenting Fragmented Rules of Origin of RTAs: A Building Block to Global Free Trade,['Won-Mog Choi'],"Regional trade agreements (RTAs) provide countries with many benefits. The multilateral trading system also receives these benefits, as successive and overlapping RTAs are the building blocks for the most viable and realistic path to global free trade. Nonetheless, the spread of criss-crossing RTAs in the world has generated serious problems, including rising transaction costs. While pursuing the long-term goal of harmonizing preferential rules of origin (ROOs), countries need to actively implement the diagonal or full accumulation system on a sectoral basis, starting from the sectors in which identical product-specific rules among participating countries have been introduced. The adoption of coequality in the change in tariff classification and regional value content (VC) rules also give trading firms more flexibility. If WTO members are able to set up model ROOs, the degree of each RTA’s deviation from this benchmark may be calculated and certain modalities for its reduction could be negotiated multilaterally. In the longer term, other systemic rules on top of ROOs need to be converged or harmonized across RTAs on a regional or global basis. The effort to defragment fragmented RTAs should continue even beyond the time when most favoured nation (MFN) tariff rates go down to zero worldwide. Even if all preferential origin regimes shall have become irrelevant by then, various other rules and procedures will still have to be converged and harmonized across RTAs.", 27 January 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 1, March 2010, Pages 111–138, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp042
4,A Real Partnership for Development? Sustainable Development as Treaty Objective in European Economic Partnership Agreements and Beyond,['Henning Grosse Ruse-Khan'],"The CARIFORUM EPA (…) is a new kind of free-trade agreement as sustainable development is the presiding principle governing the whole agreement.1
The European Community (EC) is currently negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with several groups of developing countries. An element which the EC Commission likes to highlight is the objective of sustainable development. This article analyses the potential of this ‘presiding principle’ of sustainable development as a treaty objective—in the EPAs and other treaties in international economic law. Defining parameters are the international law background on sustainable development and the role of treaty objectives in the process of interpretation. The main findings are that a sustainable development treaty objective is one (of many) legal tools to achieve an integration of economic, environmental and social interests. Its specific value lies in its substantive ambiguity which translates into domestic policy space in the implementation of international treaty obligations. This discretion is limited by any specific integration performed in the treaty negotiating process and expressed in individual treaty provisions. It is further qualified by the customary rules of treaty interpretation in international law where object and purpose is only one of several elements feeding into a holistic interpretation exercise. Its main weakness may be that it depends on domestic institutions to make effective use of the policy space to integrate and on international judicial bodies to exercise deference accordingly.", 18 March 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 1, March 2010, Pages 139–180, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp044
5,The Dsu Article 3.8 Presumption that an Infringement Constitutes a Prima Facie Case of Nullification or Impairment: When Does it Operate and Why?,['Arwel Davies'],"This article considers the origin, meaning and current relevance of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) Article 3.8 presumption that a government measure which infringes World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations constitutes a prima facie case of nullification or impairment. It is argued that the prevailing interpretation of this provision is inconsistent with its plain language and may have contributed to the tendency of respondent states to invoke the presumption in order to undermine the fundamental principle that General Agreement on Tariff and Trade/WTO rules protect competitive opportunities rather than trade flows. The key to understanding the provision resides in the acknowledgment that the concept of nullification or impairment can be understood in two different senses depending on the stage in the proceedings at which it is relevant. While there is an isolated indication that the Appellate Body is edging closer to a re-interpretation of the provision, it is suggested that the dispute settlement process could be modestly simplified with some amendments to the DSU.", 25 March 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 1, March 2010, Pages 181–204, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp043
