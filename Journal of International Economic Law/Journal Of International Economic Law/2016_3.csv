0,Will the EU’s Proposal Concerning an Investment Court System for CETA and TTIP Lead to Enforceable Awards?—The Limits of Modifying the ICSID Convention and the Nature of Investment Arbitration,['August Reinisch'],"Both the November 2015 EU Commission proposal for Investment Protection and Resolution of Investment Disputes in the EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as well as the revised February 2016 version of the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) contain an investment court system (ICS) which is a two-tier mechanism for investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS), combining elements of traditional investor-State arbitration (ISA) with judicial features. The resulting hybrid form of dispute settlement should be regarded as a permissible inter se modification of the ICSID Convention. Nevertheless, this will not ensure that the non-modifying ICSID Contracting Parties have to recognize and enforce ICS awards as ICSID awards pursuant to the specific rules of the ICSID Convention. Rather, they should be regarded as enforceable awards under the New York Convention. This latter result will ensure that the outcome of ICS dispute settlement will be enforceable not only in the respective Contracting Parties of TTIP and CETA, but also in other States parties to the New York Convention.", 19 December 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 4, December 2016, Pages 761–786, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw072
1,Dear Prudence: Allowances under International Trade and Investment Law for Prudential Regulation in the Financial Services Sector,"['Andrew D. Mitchell', ' Jennifer K. Hawkins', ' Neha Mishra']","Governments impose prudential regulations to ensure the stability of the financial sector and protect depositors and investors. However, these regulations may also restrict trade in financial services. The Annex on Financial Services of the World Trade Organization (WTO)’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) contains an exception allowing countries to take measures for ‘prudential reasons’ to protect the ‘integrity and stability of the financial system’ or to ‘protect investors, depositors, policy holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by financial service suppliers’. Corresponding provisions appear in numerous other trade and investment agreements. The WTO has now issued its first ruling on the prudential exception in Argentina – Financial Services. The ruling of the Panel recognizes the policy space necessary for countries to determine their own prudential reasons for taking measures. As disputes regarding prudential exceptions are likely to increase in the coming years, two key challenges remain in applying such exceptions: adopting an integrated international approach to prudential regulation, given the diverse views held amongst countries; and identifying effective measures in preventing risks to the financial sector.", 08 December 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 4, December 2016, Pages 787–820, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw069
2,The Standstill of Rules of Origin for Services: Towards a ‘Substantial Transformation’ Approach,['Duy-Khuong Dinh'],"While rules of origin (ROOs) for goods have been thoroughly discussed, similar rules for services remain nascent and have attracted insufficient scholarly attention to date. Despite their crucial role in determining the existence of trade in services and granting preferential treatment, current ROOs for services bear serious limitations as they are tied to the defectious approach of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). This article aims to examine the main strands of thought on this topic over the past two decades to illustrate the necessity of a new approach. It starts by affirming the importance of ROOs for services in the context of new patterns of trade. Next, it demonstrates how the GATS-based approach has brought progress in both rule-making practice and academic research to a standstill. By revisiting the ‘substantial transformation’ criterion, it then reveals the possibility of importing certain concepts from the sphere of goods to that of services and suggesting that some hints for the discussion should be found in other fields of law. Finally, it comes up with the recommendation that origin rules for services should be designed bottom-up and sector-specific.", 19 December 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 4, December 2016, Pages 845–862, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw067
3,Debunking the Myth of ‘Particular Market Situation’ In WTO Antidumping Law,"['Weihuan Zhou', ' Andrew Percival']","This article explores the issue of ‘particular market situation’ (PMS) in anti-dumping practice. PMS has become one of the most controversial issues in antidumping policy, as reflected for example in the bilateral trade activities between China and Australia, and will soon become a prominent issue at the World Trade Organization (WTO) level once the non-market economy assumption (which is currently allowed under China’s WTO Accession Protocol) expires on 11 December 2016. Essentially, since some of the underlying concerns that led to the creation of such an assumption may endure following December 2016, countries may want to resort to other alternative methods to counteract Chinese imports. One such alternative is to resort to the notion of PMS which is foreseen in the WTO Antidumping Agreement. It is, therefore, important for the WTO tribunals to standardize the law and practice in relation to PMS. This article argues that the existence of a situation in a market, such as government interventions by means of regulation or financial assistance, does not in themselves constitute a PMS within the meaning of the Antidumping Agreement. Rather, a determination of a PMS must be based on an assessment of the comparability between domestic sale price and export price of the subject goods. A PMS should not be found to exist if an alleged price distortion has affected the two prices even-handedly such that a proper comparison of the prices would not be precluded. It is the responsibility of investigating authorities to undertake such an inquiry into comparability. Without such an inquiry, a finding of PMS cannot be justified and would likely result in a comparison between an undistorted normal value and a distorted export price in a manner contrary to the ‘proper comparison’ or ‘fair comparison’ standards which are enshrined in Article 2 of the Antidumping Agreement. The proposed approach to PMS finds support in the Antidumping Agreement itself, as well as in negotiating records of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the WTO, and GATT and WTO jurisprudence. Importantly, it promotes free trade by prohibiting unjustified inflation of dumping margins and discouraging tit-for-tat abuse of PMS.", 08 December 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 4, December 2016, Pages 863–892, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw071
