0,Nations and Markets,['Harlan Grant Cohen'],"Economics and security seem increasingly intertwined. Citing national security, states subject foreign investments to new scrutiny, even unwinding mergers. The provision of 5G has become a diplomatic battleground—Huawei at its center. Meanwhile, states invoke national security to excuse trade wars. The USA invoked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade national security exception to impose steel and aluminum tariffs, threatening more on automotive parts. Russia invoked that provision to justify its blockade of Ukraine, as did Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to excuse theirs of Qatar. And with the spread of COVID-19, states are invoking national security to scrutinize supply lines. Multiplying daily, such stories have led some observers to dub the era one of geoeconomics. Nonetheless, these developments remain difficult to judge, and the relationship between economics and national security remains confused and slippery. The essay seeks clarity in the deeper logic of these labels, revealing a fundamental choice between the logics of markets and the logics of state. Whether invoked to ‘secure’ borders, privacy, health, the environment, or jobs, ‘national security’ is a claim about the proper location of policymaking. Appeals to economics, with their emphasis on global welfare and global person-to-person relationships, are such claims as well. Resolving disputes, this essay argues, requires recognizing these root choices.", 03 December 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 793–815, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa032
1,Reforming WTO Conflict Management: Why and How to Improve the Use of ‘Specific Trade Concerns’,['Robert Wolfe'],"With its dispute settlement system in peril, the role of the World Trade Organization in mitigating commercial conflict is more important than ever, but its working practices need reform. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and Technical Barriers to Trade committees have developed a mechanism for members to raise ‘specific trade concerns’ about the laws, regulations, and practices of their trading partners, both proposed and already implemented. These specific trade concerns can mitigate sources of friction and help avoid recourse to formal dispute settlement. This article assesses experience with specific trade concerns and analyzes suggestions for reform of the process and its extension to all World Trade Organization committees. The important World Trade Organization reform question is whether procedural changes in Geneva can make specific trade concerns more effective for all members while facilitating enhanced participation by members who do not now make full use of the possibilities that such procedures offer.", 03 December 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 817–839, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa034
2,China’s ‘Going Global’ Policy: Transnational Production Subsidies Under the WTO SCM Agreement,"['Victor Crochet', ' Vineet Hegde']","As China is increasingly ‘going global’, foreign direct investment under its Belt and Road Initiative is becoming heavily scrutinized. One of the concerns is that Chinese companies establishing themselves in third countries would be unfairly advantaged by the financing they receive under China’s expansionist strategy. This financing gives rise to a situation that had long been described as ‘unrealistic’, in which a government subsidizes a firm outside of its territory. When such a firm’s products are exported to third countries, could such financing be disciplined under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures? Should such financing, which enhances development in the receiving countries, be disciplined at all? The authors shed light on these issues and provide a preliminary guidance on how to structure this problem under international trade law.", 28 November 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 841–863, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa029
3,The EU in Search for Stronger Enforcement Rules: Assessing the Proposed Amendments to Trade Enforcement Regulation 654/2014,"['Wolfgang Weiß', ' Cornelia Furculita']","Considering the new focus of the European Union (EU) trade policy on strengthening the enforcement of trade rules, the article presents the proposed amendments to the EU Trade Enforcement Regulation 654/2014. It analyzes the EU Commission proposal and the amendments suggested by the European Parliament Committee on International Trade (INTA), in particular with regard to uncooperative third parties and the provision of immediate countermeasures. The amendments will be assessed in view of their legality under World Trade Organization (WTO), Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and general international law and in view of their political implications for the EU’s multilateralist stance. Finally, the opportunity to amend Regulation 654/2014 to use it for the enforcement of FTA trade and sustainable development chapters will be explored. The analysis shows that the shift towards more effective enforcement should be pursued with due care for respecting existing international legal commitments and with more caution to multilateralism.", 21 November 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 865–884, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa033
4,Explaining the Limits of the WTO in Shaping the Rule of Law in China,"['Ming Du', ' Qingjiang Kong']","When China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001, pundits were enthusiastic about the prospect that China’s World Trade Organization membership would boost international trade, encourage China’s restructuring toward a market economy, discipline the domestic legal system, and strengthen the rule of law in China. More recently, however, serious concerns have been raised regarding China’s record on the rule of law. The first National Security Strategy report issued by the Trump Administration in December 2017 claimed that China’s increased participation in the liberal international economic system had not effectuated China’s deeper engagement with, or respect for, the rule of law.
The purpose of this article is to take a critical look at the two contrasting narratives on the impact of the World Trade Organization on China’s rule of law construction over the past two decades. It concludes that, although the World Trade Organization has played a positive role in advancing the rule of law in China, such a role has long been exaggerated. Accordingly, we provide an account of why the World Trade Organization has failed to play a catalyst role in instituting the rule of law in China widely expected in the western world.", 13 November 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 885–905, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa027
5,A Story Half Told—Selective Benefit Assessment in the New US CVD Rule for Exchange Rates,['Jaemin Lee'],"The new countervailing duty proceeding rule of the United States on exchange rates aims to address currency undervaluation through a subsidy tool under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. As there is no prohibition in the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) making macro-economic policies off-limits from the reach of subsidy norms, exchange rates can be subject to countervailing duty proceedings. However, there are specific requirements to be met under the ASCM and World Trade Organization jurisprudence. Most notably, the new countervailing duty proceeding rule arguably fails to meet the ‘benefit’ analysis requirements. It takes into account the effect that negatively weighs on foreign exporters subject to a countervailing duty proceeding while ignoring the one that positively weighs. This skewed benefit analysis of selective nature is difficult to sustain under the ASCM and its jurisprudence. A more detailed and thorough benefit analysis is needed to make this new scheme work in a World Trade Organization (WTO)–consistent manner. The new countervailing duty rule showcases structural problems addressing macro-economic policies through a subsidy framework.", 03 November 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 907–928, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa030
6,Investment Law before Arbitration,"['Jarrod Hepburn', ' Martins Paparinskis', ' Lauge N Skovgaard Poulsen', ' Michael Waibel']","Investment law was not always about investor–state arbitration. Based on British and German archival materials from the Cold War, this paper shows how aims and priorities in the investment treaty regime changed over time. We find important differences in the role and relative importance of different legal rules then and now. Most notably, national treatment and free transfer clauses were key in early investment law, whereas fair and equitable treatment was regarded as relatively unimportant. At the same time, early drafters did anticipate some of the most contentious issues in modern investment law, including treaty shopping, shareholder protection, and the ‘no greater rights’ proviso.", 18 December 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 929–947, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa037
7,Metanarratives as a Trap: Critique of Investor–State Arbitration Reform,['Ksenia Polonskaya'],"The ongoing reform of investment arbitration at the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law can have a lasting impact on international investment protection for the decades ahead. This paper examines the current discussions at the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law to explain why the current focus on reforming the procedural aspects of the system is too narrow. As a result of such a narrow approach, the reform risks to miss an opportunity to address the global challenges, e.g. climate change. In advancing its critique of the ongoing reform, the paper adopts the lens of metanarrative by Jean-François Lyotard. By relying on Lyotard, this paper cautions that such values as feasibility and efficiency in conducting the reform should not obscure the need for a critical conversation on the purpose of the reform, which is to ensure the legitimacy of investment arbitration in the future. As this paper argues, a current procedural approach to the reform cannot meaningfully contribute to this objective.", 18 December 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 949–971, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa038
8,Multilateralizing Investment Facilitation at the WTO: Looking for the Added Value,['N Jansen Calamita'],"Since 2017, World Trade Organization members have been engaged in Structured Discussions aimed at agreeing on a multilateral framework on investment facilitation for development. The negotiations focus on establishing binding disciplines for investment facilitation, which will likely be made subject to the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Understanding. Investment facilitation, however, is that something states already do. Over the past decade, states have adopted record numbers of reforms at the domestic, regional, and international levels to facilitate foreign investment. These reforms show no signs of slowing. This begs an important question regarding the World Trade Organization initiative: given all the attention that investment facilitation already receives from states and international organizations, how, if at all, would the conclusion of a World Trade Organization Framework bring added value to states, i.e. value that cannot be achieved by ongoing efforts? Examining this question is the focus of this paper.", 18 December 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 973–988, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa036
9,"Anti-Corruption Provisions in International Investment Agreements: Investor Obligations, Sustainability Considerations, and Symmetric Balance",['Yueming Yan'],"Incorporating anti-corruption provisions into international investment agreements is a vital step for governments to address transnational corruption in international investment. This empirical study analyses a category of anti-corruption provisions that fosters compliance by investors. These anti-corruption provisions address anti-corruption issues either within corporate social responsibility clauses or through ‘carve-out’ statements. The former encourages investors to voluntarily comply with corporate social responsibility, including anti-corruption commitments, while the latter imposes direct obligations on investors by denying substantive treaty protection or access to arbitration if their investments were obtained through corruption. However, these provisions are unsatisfactory in terms of achieving their intended objectives: promoting sustainable development and achieving a symmetrical balance between investors and states. This paper addresses two central weaknesses of anti-corruption provisions. First, corporate social responsibility-based anti-corruption provisions are soft law norms that result in limited obligations or effects. Second, ‘carve-out’ anti-corruption provisions actually favour states’ interests, because they solely evaluate investors’ conduct without considering a state’s corrupt act. This paper recommends that, in addition to promoting responsible and corruption-free investments on the investor side, states should commit to take necessary measures to promote the integrity of public officials, establish cooperation and improve anti-corruption standards, and preserve sufficient remedial measures for investors in cases of solicitation by state officials.", 18 December 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 989–1013, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa026
10,Taxation of Digital Services Under Trade Agreements,"['Chris Noonan', ' Victoria Plekhanova']","The digitalization of the economy combined with sophisticated tax planning has enabled some multinationals to avoid paying almost any income tax in most market jurisdictions from which they earn substantial profits. Faced with financial and political pressures to act, market states have sought to expand their tax bases so that these multinationals, especially those providing internet advertising and digital intermediation services, pay their ‘fair’ share of tax. The failure to reach an agreed outcome among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and Group of Twenty members has led to an increasing number of states to take unilateral measures. In doing so, states need to navigate their obligations under double taxation agreements and trade agreements. An examination of typical double taxation agreements, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and recent preferential trade agreements shows that states have limited options to expand their tax bases in compliance with their international obligations. Here, the imposition of an appropriately designed digital services tax has political and legal advantages. The growing volume of cross-border digital services and data flows suggests that greater engagement between the international tax and trade regimes is likely in the future, including in the negotiations of disciplines on electronic commerce.", 02 December 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 4, December 2020, Pages 1015–1039, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa031
