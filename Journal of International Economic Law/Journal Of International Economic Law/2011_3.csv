0,Certificates of Free Sale: Who is Being Protected from Whom?,"['Arthur E. Appleton', ' Claudio Dordi']","Certificates of Free Sale (CFS) are little known but widely used instruments in international trade. A CFS states that a product meets the regulatory requirements of the exporting country and can be sold freely in that country. Many developing countries require a CFS as a condition of importation in sensitive sectors, such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, cosmetics, and food products. This paper is the first major work to explore the legal implications of certificates of free sale. It describes various CFS requirements and examines the WTO-legality of trade restrictions imposed by importing countries based on the failure of exported goods to meet the domestic standards of the exporting country. The authors conclude that most CFS schemes are likely to violate WTO obligations. They suggest WTO-consistent ways of protecting legitimate developing country interests that eliminate the need for CFS schemes.", 16 December 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 4, December 2011, Pages 719–763, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr033
1,Mineral Export Restraints and Sustainable Development—Are Rare Earths Testing the WTO's Loopholes?,['Bin GU'],"China's actions in limiting the export of rare earths have drawn the world's attention. The USA, Japan, and the European Union (EU) have been frustrated with China's measures, even threatening to bring the case to the WTO. These rare earth trade disputes are but the tip of the iceberg. Forms of export restraints on minerals have been increasingly practiced by developing countries, reflecting developing countries’ determination to upgrade their own economic condition against a broader backdrop of international economic transition in a mineral-hungry world. Such issues of mineral export restraints are deeply rooted in the traditional international trade structure, and in turn serve as a historic move to break it. The WTO's consensus-based approach, with developing countries comprising more than two-thirds of WTO membership, has to accommodate this changing situation in both its judicial and negotiation scenarios. Accused of being trade-distorting and inconsistent with the WTO Agreement on the part of mineral export restraints, developing countries expect to defend themselves by reasons of environmental protection and conservation of exhaustible natural resources. This article anticipates that, in the next round of multilateral negotiation, the developed world will attempt to bring the issue of export restraints under multilateral mandates.", 23 December 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 4, December 2011, Pages 765–805, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr034
2,China's Anti-Monopoly Law and its Merger Enforcement: Convergence and Flexibility,['Dan Wei'],"As the world's second largest economy and the world's fastest growing economy, China is a late but significant entrant into the competition law club with the implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) on 1 August 2008. This article provides a review of the enactment of the AML and a detailed discussion of the merger provisions and application of those provisions by the competition enforcement agency. Despite the short history of application of the AML, empirical findings on merger enforcement illustrate that China is making efforts to realize a soft convergence with international norms. Meanwhile, China's gradual approach to convergence gives it the flexibility to stop, to adjust, and to make an exception whenever necessary to accommodate its transitional and growing economy.", 19 December 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 4, December 2011, Pages 807–844, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr032
3,The Conundrum of Shifting Orthodoxies: FTAs And Korea's Currency Controls,['Jane Kelsey'],"The financial services regime, comprising the General Agreement on Trade in Services and bilateral free trade and investment agreements, reflects the ‘orthodoxy’ of highly liberalized and lightly regulated financial markets that has supported the ascendancy of financialization. That orthodoxy has fractured as the post-2007 global financial crisis exposed systemic instability in the financialization model and the failings of the associated regulatory regime. Yet, binding and enforceable financial services and investment agreements tie governments to that regime. Although international institutions and commentators increasingly advocate alternative strategies, such as the imposition of currency controls, governments that adopt them risk legal challenges for breaching their trade obligations. This risk is illustrated by assessing South Korea's capital controls of June 2010 against the market access, national treatment and transfers obligations, investment protections and prudential exceptions in Korea's free trade agreements with the USA and the European Union. To date, states whose firms dominate global finance have resisted high-profile calls within and outside the World Trade Organization to revisit the financial services regime. If they maintain that position, these embryonic tensions seem likely to intensify. Placing unacceptable constraints on national governments could propel the trade in financial services regime towards a crisis of legitimacy.", 22 December 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 4, December 2011, Pages 845–868, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr031
4,EC – Fasteners: Opening the Pandora's Box of Non-Market Economy Treatment,['Michelle Q. Zang'],"On 15 July 2010, the Appellate Body of the WTO circulated its report in EC – Fasteners. In its report, the Appellate Body, for the first time, adjudicated the issue of non-market economy (NME) treatment towards imports from China and provided plausible interpretations of China's special commitments under the Accession Protocol and certain articles of the Anti-Dumping Agreement. However, a number of NME-related questions remain unanswered owing to the scope of claims submitted by the applicants. Insofar as the enforcement of WTO rulings is concerned, legislation amendments, as required in the report, are imperative during the implementation process of the European Union. Furthermore, there is also the chance that the European Court will award duty repayment to importers that have been subject to NME country-wide duties.", 04 January 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 4, December 2011, Pages 869–892, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr035
