0,The Puzzle of Agricultural Exceptionalism in International Trade Policy,"['Michael Trebilcock', ' Kristen Pue']","This article first seeks to demonstrate the exceptional levels of protectionism accorded to the agricultural sector, especially in many developed countries. It reviews the principal protectionist measures employed: domestic subsidies and price supports, production restrictions, and border measures; describes briefly the disciplines applicable to these measures under World Trade Organization law; and then surveys empirical evidence on the extent of protectionism that prevails in the agricultural sector in many countries. Next, it evaluates the principal normative justifications often offered for exceptional levels of agricultural protectionism: ensuring access to affordable food; ensuring a livable income for farmers; and preserving traditional rural lifestyles and communities. It finds that these are not especially compelling either relative to many other economic sectors or in terms of first-best policy responses to the normative concerns in question. The article then considers political economy explanations for exceptional levels of protectionism in agriculture—including Public Choice explanations and the transitional gains trap—which, while providing some purchase on the phenomenon, are again not completely compelling. The article concludes with some observations on how liberalization of trade in agricultural products might be advanced in the future.", 19 May 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2015, Pages 233–260, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv022
1,Energy Subsidies and WTO Dispute Settlement: Why Only Renewable Energy Subsidies Are Challenged,['Henok Birhanu Asmelash'],"Over the past few years, renewable energy subsidies have become one of the main sources of trade disputes at the WTO. A total of six cases have been initiated against renewable energy subsidy programmes since the first of such disputes was brought by Japan against Canada’s Feed-in Tariff (FIT) Program in 2010. Yet not even a single case has so far been initiated against the much larger and environmentally harmful fossil fuel subsidies. The main objective of this article is to examine what makes renewable energy subsidies vulnerable to WTO dispute, as compared to fossil fuel subsidies.", 19 May 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2015, Pages 261–285, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv024
2,Reconciling Rules of Origin and Global Value Chains: The Case for Reform,"['Dylan Geraets', ' Colleen Carroll', ' Arnoud R. Willems']","Rules of Origin (ROO) are in need of reform. Aside from being used for protectionist purposes, they have also become so complicated that they result in companies foregoing trade preferences granted by preferential agreements on a substantial scale. This article makes the argument for a fundamental reconceptualization of ROO, based on today’s Global Value Chains (GVCs). The article is divided in four sections. First, it surveys the methods currently applied for assigning origin. Second, existing obstacles to reform are then outlined. A third section briefly examines previous attempts at reforming ROO. Fourth, the contours and possible ramifications of a value-added approach to determining origin are explored, given that (i) ROO are not suitable for today’s world characterized by GVCs; and (ii) the tension between bilaterally established rules and multilateral decision-making continues to hamper attempts at harmonization or reform. Considering that the assembly stage of the production process is no longer the stage in which most value is added to the final product, it is argued that other aspects of the production process—such as R&D, design, intellectual property, and marketing—should be taken into account in the valuation of the product in question. This contribution offers a general proposal for reform. Flexible ROO that take into account these aspects are better suited for a trading landscape characterized by GVCs.", 22 May 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2015, Pages 287–305, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv017
3,Challenges and Solutions for the China–US BIT Negotiations: Insights from the Recent Development of FTZs in China,['Jie Huang'],"Before conducting profound reforms of the trade and investment legal framework, China often implements the reforms on a small scale, generally in specified geographic zones, as testing grounds. From 2013 to 2015, China established four free trade zones (FTZs) as pilot projects to test how to update Chinese trade and investment law, boost China’s economy, and prepare China for high-standard BITs/FTAs negotiations. This article analyzes the interactions between China’s FTZs and the China–US BIT negotiations, and explores what insights gathered from China’s FTZs can provide a better approach to challenges in the China–US BIT negotiations. It concentrates on three issues of the BIT negotiations: non-conforming measures, pre-establishment national treatment, and transparency. For each issue, this article compares other BITs concluded by China and the USA and analyzes their differences, then it explores the reasons for the differences and how they can be reconciled by experiments in China’s FTZs, and finally it proposes solutions for the China–US BIT negotiations.", 14 May 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2015, Pages 307–339, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv018
4,Cartels and the Right to Food: An Analysis of States’ Duties and Options,['Tristan Feunteun'],"Hunger has complex causes and can be exacerbated by the actions and/or inactions of various actors, such as states, intergovernmental organizations, and transnational corporations. Globalization has stretched food supply chains worldwide, with an accompanying increase in the harm upon the right to food (RTF) being imposed by extraterritorial parties (whether transnational corporations, foreign states, or intergovernmental organizations). The RTF under international human rights law accommodates the complexities of this, and presents states with a variety of obligations and/or responsibilities within a framework that seeks to respect, protect, and fulfil the RTF. This article will focus on one discrete yet widespread aspect of distortions in agricultural markets and food systems in general, namely collusive price-fixing cartels. The existing literature has largely ignored the nexus of these important issues. First, this article will analyse the (scale of the) effects of such cartels on the RTF. Secondly, it will then examine the respect–protect–fulfil obligations and/or responsibilities of states to regulate such cartels in light of this, embedding the analysis of the problem posed by cartels (and the potential solutions thereto) within this framework. States, with regards to cartels involving transnational corporations in the food sector, have obligations and/or responsibilities to take all appropriate measures to tackle the problem. Such measures include using competition law to regulate the behaviour of transnational corporations and other market participants. Thirdly, this article will examine how competition law and similar mechanisms might yet be developed into effective tools to help states to meet these obligations and/or responsibilities regarding the RTF and to mitigate the effects of cartels upon this, notwithstanding the lack of consensus regarding competition law at the Ministerial Conferences of the World Trade Organization held in Doha and Cancún. This article concludes that hunger in the 21st century is a many-headed monster, and that the RTF obliges all states to assess and adapt all possible tools at their disposal—competition law included—to tackle one particular head of that monster: the impact of cartels on the RTF.", 03 June 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2015, Pages 341–382, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv019
5,"Protection of Non-Trade Values in WTO Appellate Body Jurisprudence: Exceptions, Economic Arguments, and Eluding Questions",['Henrik Andersen'],"The article suggests that the constitutional scope of the WTO leaves a wide space for the Appellate Body to protect non-trade values. That has, to some extent, materialized in Appellate Body practice; human health and environment are attaining general protection across the WTO treaties. They are recognized as vital and important values and protected through the exceptions in the WTO treaties. However, the Appellate Body has also found ways to protect those values without resorting to the exceptions. Instead, they are part of an economic argument in national treatment analyses and they are part of economic externality assessments in subsidy determinations. It is, however, still unsettled how other vital values, like those which can fall under peremptory norms, can be protected by the Appellate Body and whether its current approach provides the necessary tools for their protection.", 16 May 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2015, Pages 383–405, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv020
6,Explaining China’s Tripartite Strategy Toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement,['Ming Du'],"The emergence of mega-regional trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) threatens to fragment global trade governance in fundamental ways. An important question, yet so far under-explored, is how the rising powers currently being excluded from the mega-regionals, such as China, view this new development in global economic governance. This article intends to fill this gap in the literature from a Chinese perspective. Specifically, this article addresses the following questions: why has China changed its initial suspicious attitude to a more neutral stance toward the TPP recently? What are the short-term and long-term effects of the TPP on China’s economic growth and geopolitical influence? How will China deal with a myriad of challenges posed by the TPP going forward, be it in or outside the TPP? After the analysis of a range of relevant political, economic, and legal factors, I submit that the Chinese government has adopted what I call a ‘tripartite strategy’ toward the TPP. What remains to be seen is whether this tripartite strategy provides the best roadmap for China’s further integration into the global economy.", 22 May 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2015, Pages 407–432, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv021
7,Deflection of Trade upon Enlargement of the European Union,['Nicolaj Kuplewatzky'],"Enlarging the European Union (EU) permits traders to avoid the exposure to any contingent trade-protection measure without violating the letter of the law under which the protective measure is established. This practice is also known as the ‘deflection of trade’. Not just since the solar panels investigations in 2013, but certainly with heightened attention to the issue, the deflection of trade is yet to be addressed by the European institutions. However, this practice is not solely confined to enlargement of the EU, and, in fact, is likely to resurface before enlargement of any customs union committed to a free circulation of goods and the removal of internal frontiers. In light of this obvious exploitation of the enlargement process, the guiding question for this article will be whether the deflection of trade is a necessary evil for such trade blocs. Looking at both EU and WTO law, this article will analyse whether the necessary tools to tackle the deflection of trade are already present. Ultimately, the author concludes that the EU law doctrine on the abuse of rights is the most appropriate tool to tackle this practice.", 19 May 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2015, Pages 433–447, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv023
8,Cybersecurity Threats and the WTO National Security Exceptions,['Shin-yi Peng'],"The practice of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/World Trade Organization (WTO) is inconclusive on the issue of national security. From Nicaragua Embargo to China-Rare Earth, the key question of the security exceptions remains unanswered. The examination of Article XXI(b)(iii) in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties confirms that the security exception is not totally self-judging. This article argues that the principle of good faith can explain how far the self-judging power can go. After taking the potential dispute on Huawei as an occasion for exploring the trade implications of security measures, this article finds that fact-finding and evidence gathering are the most troubling aspect of application of such exceptions. The responding member invoking Article XXI(b) must ‘reasonably’ classify cybersecurity as ‘essential security interests’ in the context of an ‘international relations emergency’, and it must ‘genuinely believe’ that cybersecurity regulations based solely upon where the supplier’s headquarter is located in a globally connected world can contribute to the achievement of the country’s national security protection. After engaging in the two-stage exercises of the ‘good faith’ test, this article maintains that there is a need for a WTO panel to actively intervene by seeking information from other governments or nongovernmental bodies, evaluating and weighing the evidence, carefully balancing rights and obligations constructed by the WTO Agreement, and establishing an appropriate trade regime to deal with cybersecurity threats.", 23 May 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 2, June 2015, Pages 449–478, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv025
