0,The Smoot–Hawley Fixation: Putting the Sino-US Trade War in Contemporary and Historical Perspective,['Simon J Evenett'],"The extent to which the Sino-US trade war represents a break from the past is examined. This ongoing trade war is benchmarked empirically against the Smoot–Hawley tariff increase and against the sustained, covert discrimination by governments against foreign commercial interests witnessed since the start of the global economic crisis. The Sino-US trade war is not the defining moment that some contend. Thus, laying the blame for the current woes of global trade entirely at the feet of policymakers in Beijing or Washington, D.C., is unfounded. Since the rot started well before 2018 and implicates many states, greater attention should be given to the factors determining the unilateral commercial policies of governments during and after a systemic economic crisis. The insights from the economic history literature of the 1930s presented here are useful in this regard. Moreover, claims that existing multilateral trade rules have bite are hard to square with the very large shares of global trade affected by policy measures favouring local firms implemented over the past decade. When confronted with severe adverse economic conditions for better or for worse, WTO members had plenty of policy space after all.", 06 December 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2019, Pages 535–555, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz039
1,WTO’ing a Resolution to the China Subsidy Problem,"['Chad P Bown', ' Jennifer A Hillman']","The USA, European Union, and Japan have begun a trilateral process to confront the Chinese economic model, including its use of industrial subsidies and deployment of state-owned enterprises. This paper seeks to identify the main areas of tension and to assess the legal-economic challenges to constructing new rules to address the underlying conflict. It begins by providing a brief history of subsidy disciplines in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and World Trade Organization predating any concerns introduced by China. It then describes contemporary economic problems with China’s approach to subsidies, their impact, and the apparent ineffectiveness of the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures to address them. Finally, it calls for increased efforts to measure and pinpoint the source of the problems—in a manner analogous to how the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development took on agricultural subsidies in the 1980s—before providing a legal-economic assessment of proposals for reforms to notifications, evidence, remedies, enforcement, and the definition of a subsidy.", 06 December 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2019, Pages 557–578, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz035
2,Undermining the Consensus-Building and List-Based Standards in Export Controls: What the US Export Controls Act Means to the Global Export Control Regime,['Cindy Whang'],"On 13 August 2018, US President Donald Trump signed a legislation called the ‘Export Controls Act of 2018’ (ECA) that is important for reinvigorating the export control regime in the USA. This paper argues that contents of the ECA will not only impact the USA but also the way that the ECA is structured will potentially have a long-lasting influence on international export control regimes and the role that export controls play in international trade.
International export control regimes were established post-World War II as a trade measure to pursue common strategic and national security goals among allied countries. Due to the sensitive nature of national security issues, international export control agreements were structured as non-binding agreements that heavily relied on the consensus of participating countries in formulating export control lists that the participating countries could then adopt in their domestic regulations. The cohesiveness of the global export control regimes has been based on the cornerstones of the consensus-building and list-based standards. The USA established its export control regimes to complement these international export control regimes and has been a strong proponent of requesting countries to adopt the international export control lists into domestic regulations. With the passage of the ECA, the infusion of economic policy considerations such as maintaining the USA’s technological leadership through adding a category of emerging and foundational technology has changed the long-standing export control narrative. Through the changes made to the US ECA, the scope of national security subject to export control regimes has expanded from being focused on military-oriented goods and technology into one that now includes commercial technology. While the changes made through the ECA serve to protect the USA’s technological interests, the statute could also undermine important elements of the global export control regime that the international community has established in the past seventy years post-World War II.", 30 November 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2019, Pages 579–599, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz038
3,Beyond Rational Choice: International Trade Law and The Behavioral Political Economy of Protectionism,"['Anne van Aaken', ' Jürgen Kurtz']","The classic political economy of trade models state behavior on the international plane by reference to the formation of domestic interests. Voters, interest groups, and politicians are rational actors in this model, pursuing their economic preferences without cognitive or motivational distortions. This article questions the sufficiency of the rational choice model in the formation of contemporary trade policy. Starting from the classic political economy story, this article explores real-world deviations from rationally expected outcomes by drawing on cognitive psychology. Using both theoretical and empirical analysis, we seek to identify key distortions that can better explain voter and politician behavior in the current trade wars. We begin with loss aversion in that individuals have asymmetrical attitudes towards gains and losses. Rising inequality within the rich world amounts to a perceived relative loss particularly for middle-class citizens. Combined with the absolute rise of equality between countries, this can trigger a double loss frame—both as an individual loss and a national loss—that can profoundly shape anti-trade preferences in certain countries. Framing trade as a security threat also invokes powerful hawkish biases. Lastly, the availability bias can be provoked by social media mechanisms making people tend to focus on particular risks and overweight their import.", 27 December 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2019, Pages 601–628, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz034
4,Investment Wars: Contestation and Confusion in Debate About Investment Liberalization,['Jonathan Bonnitcha'],"Questions of investment governance are central to current trade wars. The USA complains of China’s use of restrictions on US investment as a lever to force technology transfer, while China complains of the review of investment in the USA on national security grounds. This article examines the place of these debates about investment liberalization within the trade wars. The focus is on US conduct, as the instigator of the trade wars. I argue that the USA is pursuing diverse and partially inconsistent in relation to investment liberalization. In some contexts, the USA is continuing to pursue the objective of removing impediments to outward investment, which was the principal objective of US investment policy for the decades prior to the Trump administration. In other contexts, the USA is seeking to encourage the repatriation of US outward investment and to regulate inward and outward investment according to ill-defined security rationales. I argue that prevailing materialist accounts of the trade wars struggle to explain these inconsistencies. Instead, I suggest that constructivist political economy provides a more promising explanatory framework. According to this view, inconsistency in policy objectives stems from foundational uncertainty about the nature of the ‘problem’ of investment liberalization.", 13 December 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2019, Pages 629–654, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz040
5,Toward a Geoeconomic Order in International Trade and Investment,"['Anthea Roberts', ' Henrique Choer Moraes', ' Victor Ferguson']","Recent developments suggest that the international economic order is transitioning away from the Neoliberal Order that has flourished for much of the post-Cold War period toward a new Geoeconomic Order. The shift to this new order, which is characterized by a growing ‘securitisation of economic policy and economisation of strategic policy’, will likely see the rules, norms, and institutions of international trade and investment law undergoing significant change. We expose the differences in the underlying logic of these orders, explore how this shift is being driven by the emerging USA–China tech/trade war, and consider the consequences of this transition for global economic governance.", 25 November 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2019, Pages 655–676, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz036
6,Heterodox markets and ‘market distortions’ in the global trading system,['Andrew Lang'],"An important context for contemporary trade frictions is the emergence, since the 1990s, of a wide range of new forms of market capitalism, of which China’s hybrid market economy is the most significant. Institutional diversity of this kind is a source of strength and dynamism for the global trading system, but it is also the cause of very serious friction. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization system has dealt with this problem before, but the existing settlement regarding the legitimate boundaries of institutional diversity is under pressure and needs to be revisited. One concept that has been incorporated into World Trade Organization trade defence law (and elsewhere) to help draw these boundaries is the concept of the ‘market distortion’. The concept can be a useful one, but it has so far been interpreted and applied with an inadequate appreciation of its serious conceptual and practical difficulties. The potential result is a system of trade defences targeted in a discriminatory and even punitive manner against heterodox institutional forms, in ways that may excessively disincentivize institutional experimentation. In response, this paper argues for an approach to the interpretation and application of this concept, which proceeds from an understanding of the institutionally embedded character of markets. This does not take the form of a readily available ‘solution’, but rather a messy and evolving set of legal techniques that, in the best case, can form the legal basis of a practical and justifiable approach to the tensions caused by institutional diversity. A toolkit of legal techniques of this kind clearly cannot take the place of a more foundational political settlement of some sort, but it is a necessary accompaniment to it, if we are to preserve the aspiration towards a genuinely non-discriminatory and rules-based global economic order.", 07 December 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2019, Pages 677–719, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz042
7,"At the Vanishing Point of Law: Rebalancing, Non-Violation Claims, and the Role of the Multilateral Trade Regime in the Trade Wars",['Nicolas Lamp'],"What role can the multilateral trade regime play in the trade wars triggered by the USA under the Trump administration? This article argues that the traditional goal of dispute settlement in the WTO—the positive resolution of disputes—has become largely unattainable in the circumstances of the trade wars, but that the regime can still play a valuable role by providing a framework for the rebalancing of obligations among the participants. Using the regime in this way would defuse tensions among the participants, would ensure that any new equilibrium that they achieve is integrated into the legal structure of the trade regime, and would provide the participants the opportunity to use the trade regime’s tools for solving disagreements at the margins, thereby lowering the risk that trade retaliation will spiral out of control. The article uses the example of non-violation claims in the context of national security measures to illustrate the potential for and benefits of re-integrating the trade wars into the multilateral trade regime. The article provides a detailed discussion of the legal justification for non-violation complaints in response to national security measures and argues that such claims provide an alternative course of action that is less confrontational than unilateral retaliation or violation claims, and faster to adjudicate than violation claims.", 27 December 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2019, Pages 721–742, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz041
8,Forced Technology Transfer and the US–China Trade War: Implications for International Economic Law,['Julia Ya Qin'],"Forced technology transfer has emerged from the US–China trade war as a new issue of systemic importance. The USA, the European Union, and Japan have jointly condemned forced technology transfer as a practice undermining the proper function of international trade and called for new WTO rules to discipline the practice. This article examines the issue in the broad context of international economic law. It seeks to address the following questions: What does ‘forced technology transfer’ mean? Where did this practice come from? Why is there insufficient international regulation on the issue? What exactly are the problems inherent in such practice? And what can be done to improve the relevant international regulation?", 02 December 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 4, December 2019, Pages 743–762, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz037
