0,Multilevel Governance Problems of the World Trading System beyond the WTO Conference at Bali 2013,['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"This contribution argues that the perennial negotiations on adjustments of the law of the WTO (e.g. by means of the Doha Round negotiations) and of UN law (e.g. adjustments of the IMF quota and voting system, UN climate change regulations) reflect systemic problems of multilevel governance of international public goods (PGs) that call for reviewing traditional regulatory approaches at national and international levels of governance (as discussed in Sections II and III) so as to better respond to the ‘collective action problems’ of multilevel governance of international PGs (as discussed in Section IV). The concluding Section V draws policy lessons from the WTO agreements adopted at the WTO Ministerial Conference at Bali. Rather than lamenting about ‘fragmentation’ of UN and WTO law, bilateral, regional and other plurilateral agreements can be justified as necessary instruments for reforming international law for the benefit of citizens; the ‘consistent interpretation’—and ‘judicial comity’—requirements of national and international legal systems call for interpreting such agreements in conformity with the UN and WTO legal obligations of contracting parties as integral parts of multilevel governance of ‘aggregate PGs’ demanded by citizens.", 30 May 2014,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 17, Issue 2, June 2014, Pages 233–270, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgu023
1,Regionalism and Overlap in Investment Treaty Law: Towards Consolidation or Contradiction?,['Wolfgang Alschner'],"States increasingly conclude intra- and inter-regional treaties to protect foreign investment. In many instances, these regional treaties will overlap with existing bilateral investment treaties. This article finds that every fourth bilateral interstate relationship is affected by such overlap. Only few states use regionalism to de jure or de facto consolidate their investment treaty network. Most countries opt for parallel bilateral and regional treaty layers. Such overlap raises coordination challenges as parallel treaties may duplicate or contradict each other increasing the risk of parallel proceedings, double jeopardy, and normative conflict. As these challenges are not specific to investment law, and also exist in trade law, states should draw from both fields in order to develop solutions. By using a comparative perspective, this article identifies new areas for cross-fertilization between both disciplines and offers guidance on how best to manage vertical treaty overlap arising from regionalism.", 16 June 2014,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 17, Issue 2, June 2014, Pages 271–298, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgu025
2,"Balance, Sustainable Development, and Integration: Innovative Path for BIT Practice",['Zeng Huaqun'],"Bilateral investment treaties (BITs) have emerged as one of the most remarkable recent developments in international law and the hot topic of international lawyers. The author indicates that in the history of BIT practice, there is an issue on imbalance and/or un-equality between developed states and developing states due to historical and practical reasons. Under the economic globalization the main clauses of BITs have been further developed to the traditional track elaborately designed by developed states, providing high level substantial and procedural protection and aiming at ‘investment liberalization’ for the interests of developed states and their overseas investors. For correcting the imbalance and un-equality of traditional BIT practice and reconstructing the international investment regime, states and international society have to reach consensus by concepts of ‘balance’, ‘sustainable development’ and ‘integration’, draft new model BITs and conduct new BIT practice.", 16 June 2014,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 17, Issue 2, June 2014, Pages 299–332, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgu019
3,Treaty Structure and Public Interest Regulation in International Economic Law,['Bradly J. Condon'],"This article analyzes how treaty structure affects regulatory autonomy by shifting the point in a treaty in which tribunals address public interest regulation. The article also analyzes how trade and investment treaties use a variety of structures that influence their interpretation and the manner in which they address public interest regulation. WTO and investment tribunals have addressed public interest regulation in provisions regarding a treaty’s scope of application, obligations and public interest exceptions. The structure of treaties affects a tribunal’s degree of deference to regulatory choices. In treaties that do not contain general public interest exceptions, tribunals have excluded public interest regulation from the scope of application of the treaty as a whole or the scope of application of specific obligations. If treaty parties wish to preserve a greater degree of regulatory autonomy, they can limit the general scope of application of a treaty, or the scope of application of specific obligations, which places the burden of proof on the complainant. In cases where the complexity of the facts or the law make the burden of proof difficult to meet, this type of treaty structure makes it more difficult to prove treaty violations and thus preserves regulatory autonomy to a greater degree.", 24 May 2014,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 17, Issue 2, June 2014, Pages 333–353, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgu016
4,Diminished Ambitions? Public International Legal Authority in the Transnational Economic Era,['Caroline E. Foster'],"Ambition for employing public international legal authority as a means for the protection of human health and the environment appears to be diminishing in our transnationalist economic era. Practical and political challenges in defining the complex relationships between States and transnationally active commercial interests contribute to this. Emphasis on States’ domestic regulatory autonomy within contemporary international economic law is also a significant factor. This article canvasses three areas of international law and economic activity where the phenomenon of diminished ambition is manifest: responsibility, liability, and dispute settlement. Respectively, the article looks at developments in the three fields of law of the sea, international environmental law, and dispute settlement in the World Trade Organisation and through investment treaty arbitration. The article focuses on three specific topics within these three fields: the regulation of (i) deep seabed exploitation, (ii) possible risks associated with biotechnology, and (iii) tobacco regulation and public health. The article concludes that the result of our diminished ambition is to leave important areas of transnational economic activity unregulated, and encourages reflection on this phenomenon with a view to a strengthened approach in the areas where this will matter most.", 27 May 2014,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 17, Issue 2, June 2014, Pages 355–397, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgu017
5,GATS Disciplines on Capital Transfers and Short-term Capital Inflows: Time for Change?,['Gabriel Gari'],"The article examines General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) disciplines on capital transfers in light of the challenges stemming from massive surges of short-term capital. It identifies circumstances where the Agreement outlaws controls on capital inflows that are necessary for maintaining the recipient’s country monetary and exchange rate stability. It also identifies circumstances where the Agreement allows controls on capital inflows that confer a trade advantage to the recipient country by preventing the appreciation of an undervalued exchange rate. The findings suggest the Agreement fails to secure an adequate balance between trade liberalization, capital mobility and macroeconomic and financial stability. The article argues that the problem is aggravated by the differences between GATS and IMF disciplines on capital transfers and offers some thoughts on ways to improve the lack of coherence of the current global economic governance structure related to cross-border capital flows.", 27 May 2014,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 17, Issue 2, June 2014, Pages 399–435, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgu018
6,Use It or Lose It: Assessing the Compatibility of the Paris Convention and TRIPS Agreement with Respect to Local Working Requirements,"['Thomas Cottier', ' Shaheeza Lalani', ' Michelangelo Temmerman']","To what extent should countries with different levels of social and economic development be treated differently; to what extent are existing international standards too high for developing countries and least developed countries? This article analyses a particular question of World Trade Organization law at the crossroads between legal and economic matters in a development context. It analyses the question of whether countries are (and should be) allowed to require local production in return for the grant of a patent right. An examination of relevant national legislation from a selection of WTO Member States sets the stage for an analysis of the question of how the Paris Convention and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights—a priori establishing contradictory principles with respect to local working requirements—can be reconciled with the economic literature on point. The authors offer a rubric/checklist of elements to be considered in evaluating the benefits of local working requirements and suggest that below a certain threshold, which is malleable to the principle of graduation, exceptions to obligations under the TRIPS Agreement should be made.", 30 May 2014,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 17, Issue 2, June 2014, Pages 437–471, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgu026
