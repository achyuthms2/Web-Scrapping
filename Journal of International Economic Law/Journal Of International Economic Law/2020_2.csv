0,Facilitating Access to Cross-Border Supplies of Patented Pharmaceuticals: The Case of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"['Frederick M Abbott', ' Jerome H Reichman']","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into stark relief the gaps in global preparedness to address widespread outbreaks of deadly viral infections. This article proposes legal mechanisms for addressing critical issues facing the international community in terms of providing equitable access to vaccines, treatments, diagnostics, and medical equipment. On the supply side, the authors propose the establishment of mandatory patent pools (‘Licensing Facilities’) on a global or regional, or even national basis, depending upon the degree of cooperation that may be achieved. The authors also discuss the importance of creating shared production facilities. On the demand side, the authors propose the establishment of Regional Pharmaceutical Supply Centers (RPSCs) for the collective procurement of products, and the need to coordinate the issuance of necessary compulsory licenses for production and/or importation, depending on relevant circumstances. The authors envisage that centralized coordination by RPSCs should assist in overcoming difficulties individual countries may encounter in addressing administrative and technical issues in procuring supplies, as well as creating improved bargaining leverage with potential suppliers. The authors finally address the problem created by the decision of various high-income countries to ‘opt out’ as eligible importing countries under the World Trade Organization TRIPS Agreement Article 31bis amendment that addresses the predominant export of pharmaceutical products under compulsory licenses.", 28 September 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 535–561, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa022
1,Women at the Frontline of COVID-19: Can Gender Mainstreaming in Free Trade Agreements Help?,['Amrita Bahri*'],"Health pandemics affect women and men differently, and they can make the existing gender inequalities much worse. COVID-19 is one such pandemic, which can have substantial gendered implications both during and in the post-pandemic world. Its economic and social consequences could deepen the existing gender inequalities and roll back the limited gains made in respect of women empowerment in the past few decades. The impending global recession, multiple trade restrictions, economic lockdown, and social distancing measures can expose vulnerabilities in social, political, and economic systems, which, in turn, could have a profound impact on women’s participation in trade and commerce. The article outlines five main reasons that explain why this health pandemic has put women employees, entrepreneurs, and consumers at the frontline of the struggle. It then explores how free trade agreements can contribute in repairing the harm in the post-pandemic world. In doing so, the author sheds light on various ways in which the existing trade agreements embrace gender equality considerations and how they can be better prepared to help minimize the pandemic-inflicted economic loss to women.", 10 September 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 563–582, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa023
2,Selective Reshaping: China’s Paradigm Shift in International Economic Governance,['Heng Wang'],"In contrast with the selective adaptation approach toward external norms seen in its accession to the World Trade Organization, China increasingly plays a proactive role on the international stage, with the Belt and Road Initiative at the center of these activities. How can we understand this new approach by China toward international economic governance? What is responsible for China’s shifting approach, and what are the implications of this shift? The paper presents selective reshaping as a new theoretical framework, and argues that China is shifting toward the selective reshaping of institutions and rules within the global economic order. Within this theoretical framework, perception and conception, complementarity and legitimacy are influencing components that affect selective reshaping, and which manifest substantially differently in this context, when compared with selective adaptation. Selective reshaping is likely to transform the institutions and rules within the international economic order, and carry long-term implications.", 28 October 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 583–606, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa021
3,A New Chinese Economic Order?,"['Gregory Shaffer', ' Henry Gao']","China is incrementally developing a new, decentralized model of trade governance through a web of finance, trade, and investment initiatives involving memorandum of understanding, contracts, and trade and investment treaties, supported by an indigenous innovation policy that is transnational in its reach. In this way, China could create a vast, Sino-centric, legal order in which the Chinese state plays the nodal role. It is a hub and spokes model, with China at the hub. In this article, we first examine China’s export of an infrastructure-based development model, implemented through Chinese state-owned and private enterprise investments and commercial contracts (Part B), before turning to China’s development of a complementary web of free trade and investment agreements (Part C), and an indigenous innovation policy (Part D). The paper theorizes and empirically traces how these Chinese initiatives shape the evolving ecology of the transnational legal order for trade.", 30 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 607–635, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa013
4,Interface 2.0 in Rules on State-Owned Enterprises: A Comparative Institutional Approach,['Ru Ding'],"Interface mechanisms in international economic law refer to international, regional, or domestic legal instruments that resolve problems arising from differences in economic systems. The existing interface mechanism regarding disciplining state-owned enterprises (SOEs)’ activities remains unclear and has led to disputes and a divergence of views among major trading partners, most notably between the United States and China. The underlying cause is the lack of an analytical framework to understand SOEs from a comparative view that may foster consensus-building discussions. This article constructs a comparative institutional framework to understand SOEs in a variety of market economy settings, which inspires new approaches in analyzing SOE-related legal issues in international economic law. This article takes the ‘public body’ issue in the WTO and the new disciplines on SOEs as examples, demonstrating that a type of activity-based approach can be a new interface mechanism for international rules on SOEs.", 22 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 637–663, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa008
5,MCDF: A New Beacon of Multilateralism in Development Finance,['Bin Gu'],"The Multilateral Cooperation Center for Development Finance (MCDF) is an infant but prospectively important initiative in international development finance, initiated by China at the inaugural Belt and Road Forum in 2017, and now endorsed by eight leading international development banks worldwide. The MCDF is expected to work closely with global agendas such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), as well as with other peer institutions including the Global Infrastructure Connectivity Alliance (GICA), the Global Infrastructure Hub (GI Hub), and the Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF), in pursuing their shared goals of promoting infrastructure and connectivity investment. This article endeavors to investigate some key institutional matters for the development of the MCDF; they are the structure of its Secretariat, the funding mechanism, and the designated functions. Along the spectrum of hardening soft law, the MCDF is expected to evolve as an independent international body, to be equipped with a charter as its constituent instrument. The prospect of China’s role in the MCDF is predicated upon the understanding of Chinese culture and China’s approach toward global governance, which has been consistently demonstrated during the development of the AIIB and the BRI. China will play a leadership role in the MCDF, while behaving responsibly to other participants, including to borrower countries.", 08 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 665–684, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa010
6,"Facts, Evidence and the Burden of Proof in the World Bank Group Sanctions System",['Joachim Åhman'],"The large and growing number of international judicial and quasi-judicial bodies has made international procedural law an important part of public international law. This article examines how procedural rules of a certain type—provisions related to facts, evidence, and the burden of proof—have been designed in the World Bank Group Sanctions System. The main conclusion is that such rules play a central role, and that considerable efforts have been made during the last two decades to develop a well-functioning body of procedural provisions. However, the article also argues that certain parts of the system could be developed further, in order to make it as clear as possible what is expected from the different actors in the proceedings.", 08 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 685–702, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa015
7,To AB or Not to AB? Dispute Settlement in WTO Reform,"['Bernard M Hoekman', ' Petros C Mavroidis']","Recent debates on the operation of the World Trade Organization’s dispute resolution mechanism have focused primarily on the appellate body. We argue that this neglects the first-order issue confronting the rules-based trading system: sustaining the principle of depoliticized conflict resolution that is reflected in the negative consensus rule for the adoption of dispute settlement findings. Improving the quality of the work of panels by appointing a roster of full-time professional adjudicators, complemented by reforms to World Trade Organization working practices that reduce incentives to resort to formal dispute settlement, can resolve the main issues that led to the appellate body crisis. Effective, coherent, and consistent World Trade Organization dispute resolution need not include an appellate body. An appropriately redesigned single-stage process can serve just as well, if not better.", 02 September 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 1–20, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa020
8,"Cybersecurity, Technological Neutrality, and International Trade Law",['Gabriele Gagliani'],"There have already been several studies focusing on cybersecurity and international trade but the intersection between the two is multifaceted and can be approached from several viewpoints. This article focuses on cybersecurity and international trade from the specific perspective of technological neutrality. Although technological neutrality is recognized with different degrees of intensity both under World Trade Organization Covered Agreements and free trade agreements in a diverse range of fields (such as trade in services, technical barriers to trade, or intellectual property), its status in international trade law is unclear. In this uncertain context, it is argued here, technological neutrality has the potential of expanding the scope of trade obligations unpredictably. As a result, in the face of pressing cybersecurity concerns, technology-related trade measures risk to constantly violate trade obligations, making the trade-cybersecurity relationship even more complicated. The possibility to clarify the status of technological neutrality and the scope of technology-neutral provisions is chief among the solutions proposed in this article. Additionally, this article suggests for States either to be compensated when a trade-restrictive cybersecurity measure affects them, or to consider adopting a waiver in the field of technology, similar to what has been carried out in other areas.", 30 May 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 723–745, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa006
9,Taxes and Custom: Tax Treaties as Evidence for Customary International Law,['Céline Braumann'],"Scholars of public international law have not paid attention to international tax law in the past. This article seeks to fill this vacuum and to foster cross-field research by studying customary international law in international tax law. It assesses the value of international tax law’s most prominent feature for the identification of custom: the dense network of almost identical, bilateral double tax treaties. The primacy of source-based taxation for business profits serves as a test case for this purpose. The International Law Commission’s conclusions on the identification of customary international law constitute the theoretical reference point that informs the empirical analysis. Thus, this article simultaneously serves as a treadmill test to appraise whether the International Law Commission’s conclusions actually offer practical guidance. The analysis culminates in the conclusion that tax treaties have only little value for the identification of customary international law. First, tax treaties alone do not entail representative state practice. Second, tax treaties give rise to the pitfalls of the Baxter paradox. Third, the tax treaty network yields no evidence that any state practice originates from opinio juris. Judging by the evidence brought into play so far, states likely display uniform treaty practice in international taxation because they believe it is in their best interest, not due to any legal conviction.", 09 September 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 747–769, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa019
10,Is Data Localization a Solution for Schrems II?,['Anupam Chander'],"For the second time this decade, the Court of Justice of the European Union has struck a blow against the principal mechanisms for personal data transfer to the USA. In Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland, Maximillian Schrems, the Court declared the European Union-US Privacy Shield invalid and placed significant hurdles to the process of transferring personal data from the European Union to the USA via the mechanism of Standard Contractual Clauses. Many have begun to suggest data localization as the solution to the problem of data transfer; that is, do not transfer the data at all. I argue that data localization neither solves the problem of foreign surveillance, nor enhances personal privacy, while undermining other values embraced by the European Union.", 25 September 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 3, September 2020, Pages 771–784, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa024
