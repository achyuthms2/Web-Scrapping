0,Global Market Integration and the Creative Economy: The Paradox of Industry Convergence and Regulatory Divergence,['Rostam J. Neuwirth'],"From a macroeconomic perspective, the historical evolution of trade and commerce has been closely entangled in a two-way or paradoxical relationship with the evolution of laws, in which one is inextricably linked to the other and both mutually influence each other. At the microeconomic level, the same can be said about the relationship between businesses or industries and their underlying technologies. Recent changes, and notably, the accelerated pace at which we recognize change, has led to a widespread trend of ‘convergence’. Convergence has been recognized in different contexts, namely, in languages, technologies and industries, as well as in regulatory matters. The objective of this article is thus to first trace and describe this convergence from a linguistic, technological, and industrial perspective. Subsequently, in order to ponder the future regulatory challenges in the regulation of global trade under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO), it will focus on the question of whether technological and industrial convergence should be met by a similar trend towards regulatory convergence through regulatory harmonization. Put differently, it will critically evaluate the present situation of regulatory divergence in the form of regulatory diversity and regulatory competition with a view to contributing to the debate about improving global trade regulation in the 21st century.", 02 March 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 1, March 2015, Pages 21–50, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv012
1,Crossed Destinies: International Economic Courts and the Protection of Cultural Heritage,['Valentina Vadi'],"Economic globalization and international economic governance have spurred a more intense dialogue and interaction among nations—potentially promoting cultural diversity and providing the funds to recover and preserve cultural heritage. However, these phenomena can also jeopardize cultural heritage. Foreign direct investments in the extraction of natural resources have the ultimate capacity to change cultural landscapes and erase memory; trade in cultural goods can induce cultural homogenization. In parallel, legally binding and highly effective regimes demand states to promote and facilitate foreign direct investment and free trade. This article investigates the distinct interplay between the promotion of economic integration and the protection of cultural heritage before two separate international dispute resolution systems: i.e. investment treaty arbitral tribunals and the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Mechanism. It addresses the question as to whether international economic ‘courts’ pay adequate attention to the need of protecting cultural heritage, contributing to the coalescence of consistent narratives and emerging general principles of law. Has a cultural administrative law emerged requiring the protection of cultural heritage and an adequate balance between the same and the promotion of economic interests in international law? Are there specific contributions arising from each of the two dispute settlement mechanisms?", 11 March 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 1, March 2015, Pages 51–77, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv010
2,Navigating the Expanding Universe of International Treaties on Foreign Investment: Creation and Use of a Critical Index,"['Julien Chaisse', ' Christian Bellak']","There have been many successful attempts to analyse most of the rules and principles that make up the substance of the international law of foreign investment. There is, however, a lack of a general theory, or, at least, a tool which would allow us to analyse, compare, and make sense of this expanding patchwork of international rules on foreign investment. This article precisely aims at explaining how a combination of legal and economic perspectives can help to break new ground and allow both economists and lawyers to further grasp and analyse the complexity of the current regulatory framework. We created an index, called ‘BITSel Index’, which can help to link case studies to broader analysis and, conversely, more general theories with specific cases; this will help to conduct broader investigation among the large numbers of treaties and link general analysis to specific provisions or practices. Such an effort is not only an intellectual challenge but it also has practical and policy-oriented ramifications, especially in the light of the recurring debate on the effect of investment treaties on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows.", 02 March 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 1, March 2015, Pages 79–115, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv008
3,Exchange Rate Measures: Who Judges The Issue—IMF or WTO?,"['Vera Thorstensen', ' Carolina Müller', ' Daniel Ramos']","This article aims at adding to the debate on the impacts of exchange rate misalignment on trade. It is the continuation of an article—The Missing Link between the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), published by JIEL (May 2013). The first article presented the evolution of the regulation of exchange rates under the IMF framework and its impacts to the multilateral trading system. This article focuses on the mechanisms available to the WTO to deal with the impacts of exchange rates on trade and discusses the prerogatives of the WTO and the IMF in judging such issues. Also, this article aims to decipher what would be the IMF role in a dispute involving exchange rate brought before the dispute settlement body (DSB) of the WTO.", 10 March 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 1, March 2015, Pages 117–136, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv009
4,Whatever It Takes? Regarding the OMT Ruling of the German Federal Constitutional Court,"['Samuel Dahan', ' Olivier Fuchs', ' Marie-Laure Layus']","On 14 January 2014, the Bundesverfassungsgericht (German Contitutional Court in Karlsruhe hereafter Karlsruhe) ruled on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) programme. This ruling has prompted fierce debate among lawyers and economists for a number of reasons. First of all, the OMT programme concerned the very short-term survival of the euro. Secondly, in an unprecedented move, the Court took a position on the current incompleteness and asymmetry of the Economic and Monetary Union as well as on its future course. Indeed, the German Court has made a referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling on two matters: (i) had the ECB exceeded its mandate by infringing upon the competences of Member States in the field of economic policy, and (ii) had it violated the prohibition against sovereign debt monetization stipulated in Article 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union? While the content of the referral is critical, the decision to make a referral is in itself significant insofar as the Court has always refused to use this procedure even though such an abstention has been widely seen as a violation of European law. A third reason that the decision came under scrutiny is because the Constitutional Court added an unconventional twist to its preliminary ruling mechanism, ensuring it had the last word and reserving the option of not following the Court of Justice’s ruling. In other words, the German decision implied that although the Bundesverfassungsgericht was extending its hand to the CJEU, it was doing so with a closed fist.", 02 March 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 1, March 2015, Pages 137–151, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv007
5,Liberalizing Trade in Legal Services under Asia-Pacific FTAs: The ASEAN Case,['Pasha L. Hsieh'],"The article examines the liberalization of trade in legal services in the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its reform prospects to meet the challenges of multi-jurisdictional practice. It argues that while the ten-country bloc pledges to progressively liberalize the legal sector, ASEAN commitments under free trade agreements (FTAs) constitute merely ‘paper commitments’. To achieve the goal of the ASEAN Economic Community to form a single market and production base, a feasible, incremental roadmap is imperative to integrate the legal services market. The article first analyzes the economic impact of foreign law firms on ASEAN’s legal capacity building and the evolution of emerging ASEAN law. By assessing legal services negotiations under the World Trade Organization, the European Union, and Asia-Pacific FTAs, the article identifies issues of complexity in international arenas. The Singapore experiment further explores the effectiveness of FTAs with Australia and the USA and self-initiated FTA-plus measures such as Joint Law Ventures and Qualifying Foreign Law Practices. These case studies, along with law firms’ operations vis-à-vis regulatory changes, demonstrate the best practices. Finally, the article provides reform proposals that will accelerate the integration of ASEAN’s legal services market and enhance its competitiveness under the multilateral trading system.", 13 March 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 1, March 2015, Pages 153–185, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv011
