0,The Rule of Law in Times of Technological Uncertainty: Is International Economic Law Ready For Emerging Supervisory Trends?,['Shin-yi Peng'],"This paper identifies regulators' increasing discretionary practices in the innovation sectors and examines whether international economic law is prepared for this supervisory evolution. As demonstrated by the three cases studied, very often technology laws themselves do not entail sufficient specification, and this is primarily because they are heavily oriented toward principles more so than rules to allow for innovation. This raises the question of how to ensure that these ‘principles’ are consistently and predictably applied. GATS Article VI:1was designed to be an important tool in tackling situations in which a general scheme does not make any distinction between foreign and domestic service suppliers, but the administration of this scheme is not reasonable, objective or impartial. The provision, however, is not sufficiently forceful in a manner that safeguards due process and counters the potential abuse of administrative power.", 04 January 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 1, March 2019, Pages 1–27, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy049
1,"China’s Approach to the Belt and Road Initiative: Scope, Character and Sustainability",['Heng Wang'],"As a new form of regional multilateralism, the Belt and Road Initiative is China’s most significant strategic move for external engagement in international economic law, following its World Trade Organization accession. This paper analyses China’s approach towards the Belt and Road Initiative from a legal perspective, focusing on three questions: first, what is the proper scope of the Belt and Road Initiative? Second, is there an identifiable approach that China adopts in the Belt and Road Initiative context, and, if so, what is its key legal characteristic? Third, is China’s Belt and Road Initiative approach sustainable? Employing a functional approach in defining the Belt and Road Initiative, the article identifies three qualities to China’s approach to the Belt and Road Initiative: (i) that it is a hub-and-spoke network, (ii) it adopts a three-track institutional and mechanism approach, and (iii) a dual- track normative approach. Compared with the US trade approach (particularly the US–Mexico–Canada Agreement), these qualities reveal the key characteristic underpinning China’s Belt and Road Initiative approach: maximised flexibility regarding institutions and norms to address uncertainties and challenges in the Belt and Road Initiative. Such flexibility will likely assist in ensuring that China’s Belt and Road Initiative approach is sustainable by enabling trial-and-error, if properly managed. However, it also gives rise to concerns around China’s Belt and Road Initiative approach, especially as to its predictability, coherence, and transparency.", 04 January 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 1, March 2019, Pages 29–55, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy048
2,Beyond History and Boundaries: Rethinking the Past in the Present of International Economic Law,['Rafael Lima Sakr'],"History and boundaries are the foundations of international economic law (IEL) as a professional and intellectual field. History is often told to support a wide variety of present projects, norms, and ideas by appealing to the past. Boundary is a technique frequently used to map and defend an exclusive domain for applying the IEL expertise to a broad range of programmes, rules, and theories. This article first describes how history and boundaries interact to produce a ‘traditional’ view of IEL past and present place in the world economy. This interaction structures how lawyers assert the authority and legitimacy of IEL in global economic governance. It then argues that the commitments of the traditional approach to Anglocentrism and Modernism limit lawyers’ ability to understand and solve the present-day issues, since it produces lessons only in support of the dominant programmes, norms, and ideas under contestation. Consequently, it constrains, instead of empowers, lawyers’ imagination. Building on this critique, the article outlines an alternative approach devised to rethink the IEL field and, more importantly, which past or new projects, norms, and theories do or do not count (or should or should not count) as part of it. It concludes with reflections on how we might go about reimagining IEL in response to the contemporary challenges to global economic governance.", 19 February 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 1, March 2019, Pages 57–91, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz001
3,The Historical Lens in International Economic Law,['Steve Charnovitz'],"In recent years, scholars of international law have reemphasized historical research in new writings. The essay by Rafael Lima Sakr takes note of this scholarly trend in international economic law, and offers some cogent thoughts on the benefits and disadvantages that have eventuated from such use of historical material. Because the scholarship of Steve Charnovitz regarding the field of international economic law serves as a focal point in Sakr's essay, this short article provides me an opportunity to respond. This article explains why my scholarship has deployed a historical lens to analyze public policy challenges and to analyze the international institutions that have been established to help governments and private actors address those challenges. In addition, my article expresses my agreement with Sakr that scholars should be careful to avoid an unduly narrow perspective on what history is relevant for any particular project.", 21 March 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 1, March 2019, Pages 93–97, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz004
4,TURK-SWITCH: The Tariff-Leverage and Legal Case for Turkey’s Switch from EU–Turkey Customs Union to FTAs with the European Union and Beyond,"['Juscelino F Colares', ' Mustafa T Durmus']","Soon after becoming a World Trade Organization Member, Turkey established a Customs Union with the European Union, its biggest trade partner. Despite negotiating an average 42.6 percent tariff on slightly more than one-third of industrial goods—leaving remaining industrial goods unbound from World Trade Organization commitments—Turkey, pursuant to the Customs Union, eliminated all tariffs on European Union industrial imports. Turkey also implemented the significantly lower European Union Common External Tariffs—bindings averaging 4.1 percent—on all industrial imports from other World Trade Organization Members. In return, Turkey expected the Customs Union to be the ticket to eventual, full European Union membership. Following the non-binding yet politically significant July 2017 European Union Parliament vote suspending accession talks and the recent European Union Council ‘conclusion’ foreclosing negotiations toward ‘modernization’ of the Customs Union, Turkey’s hopes for membership or a less asymmetric Customs Union have faded. This article explains why Turkey’s switch from Customs Union to pursuing free trade agreements with the European Union and other countries would advance its overall trade interests and sketches how this move could be operationalized, both legally and transactionally.

5,"The Dark Side of Implementing Basel Capital Requirements: Theory, Evidence, and Policy","['Aurelio Gurrea-Martínez', ' Nydia Remolina']","Most financial systems around the world have imposed new capital requirements for banks in the past years. This policy seems to be justified on two powerful economic grounds. First, better capitalized banks promote financial stability by reducing banks’ incentives to take risks and increasing banks’ buffers against losses. Second, lack of compliance with a set of rules established by the Basel Committee may harm confidence on a country’s financial system. While acknowledging these potential benefits, this paper makes the often overlooked point that the full implementation of Basel capital requirements may be socially undesirable for poorer countries seeking to develop their economies. On the one hand, higher capital requirements may reduce people’s access to finance, which can be particularly problematic in emerging countries with less developed capital markets and greater problems of financial exclusion. On the other hand, the one-size-fits-all model incentivized by the Basel Committee does not take into account many emerging countries’ social and economic markets, infrastructures, and priorities. In our opinion, the presence and power of certain countries in the Basel Committee makes Basel recommendations partially biased towards those problems existing in these jurisdictions. Based on the aforementioned problems, this paper suggests some policy recommendations to promote a more resilient financial system without hampering financial inclusion and economic growth.", 19 February 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 1, March 2019, Pages 125–152, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz002
