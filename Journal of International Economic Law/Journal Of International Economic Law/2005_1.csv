0,Introduction,['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"In July 2004, the annual conference on Preparing the Doha Development Round: WTO Negotiators Meet the Academics at the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies of the European University Institute in Florence discussed the role of Developing Countries in the Doha Round: WTO Decision-Making Procedures and WTO Negotiations on Trade in Agricultural Goods and Services. As in the 2002 conference1 and 2003 conference, leading academics presented ten papers on the pertinent subjects of the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and WTO negotiators commented on these reports, eliciting stimulating discussions among WTO ambassadors, other practitioners from developed and less-developed WTO member countries, economists, political scientists and legal academics.2 This mini-symposium reproduces
— the updated text of the keynote speech by Peter Sutherland, former Director-General of the WTO, on the Development Agenda of the Doha Round;
— the evaluation by Faizel Ismail, Head of the South African Delegation to the WTO in Geneva and Chairman of the WTO negotiations on special and differential treatment, of the ‘Development Perspective’ of the WTO General Council Decision of July 2004;
— the policy proposals by Bernard Hoekman for helping less-developed WTO Members more effectively in implementing WTO rules and realizing the welfare gains offered by the WTO;
— and the suggestions by John S. Odell for enhancing the capacity of WTO chairs to influence consensus-building, and the resulting distribution of gains and losses, with due regard to the need for inclusive decision-making in the WTO.
This introduction discusses the general question underlying all conference papers: How can the development objectives of the Doha Round be defined more convincingly? Unless the Doha Round delivers obvious advantages for less-developed WTO Members that are also accepted by national parliaments and civil society as justified and ‘just’, the needed consensus on a successful conclusion of the ‘Development Round’ risks remaining elusive.", 01 June 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 2, June 2005, Pages 347–362, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi024
1,The Doha Development Agenda: Political Challenges to the World Trading System – A Cosmopolitan Perspective,['Peter Sutherland'],"The Doha Work Programme of 1 August 2004 justifies hopes for a successful conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations in 2006/2007. Developing countries must exploit more actively the opportunities which the WTO offers for promoting economic welfare through trade liberalization and legal reforms. The decisions to phase-out export subsidies and to move forward with negotiations on trade facilitation will help the WTO to realize the ‘development agenda’ of the Doha Round. Additional commitments by advanced developing countries will be necessary for enabling industrial countries to remove some of their – for developing countries most damaging – market access restrictions. In order to deliver favourable results for developing countries, market liberalization commitments have to be supplemented by special and differential treatment and a large amount of non-discretionary technical assistance to aid implementation. The WTO also has to demonstrate to the US Congress that WTO negotiations and the domestic implementation of WTO dispute settlement rulings are worthwhile. The article discusses legal and institutional WTO reforms necessary for concluding the Doha Round.", 01 June 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 2, June 2005, Pages 363–375, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi025
2,A Development Perspective on the WTO July 2004 General Council Decision,['Faizel Ismail'],"Nobel laureate Amartya Sen sees development as the process of expanding human freedoms. Applying Amartya Sen’s definition of development to the trade arena, the author identifies four elements of the development dimension in the multilateral trading system, viz. fair trade, capacity-building, balanced rules and good governance. This paper evaluates the recent WTO July 2004 General Council decisions using the above definition of the development dimension of the multilateral trading system. Each of the five critical issues negotiated in the above meeting: Agriculture, Cotton, Non-Agricultural Market Access, Singapore Issues, and the Development Issues are discussed in detail in the paper. The conclusion is cautiously optimistic, and calls on all WTO Members to build on the advances of the WTO July GC decision, as WTO Members prepare for the sixth WTO Ministerial meeting, scheduled to take place in Hong Kong in December 2005.", 01 June 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 2, June 2005, Pages 377–404, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi026
3,Operationalizing the Concept of Policy Space in the WTO: Beyond Special and Differential Treatment,['Bernard Hoekman'],"There are large differences between WTO Members in terms of resource capacity constraints and national trade policy and investment priorities. These affect the ability and willingness to incur the costs associated with implementation of new rules, as well as the net benefits of doing so. The ‘adjustment burden’ of new rules mostly will fall on developing countries, as such rules will reflect the status quo in industrialized countries (‘best practice’). This paper discusses options that have been proposed to address country differences and increase the ‘development relevance’ of the WTO. These include shifting back to a club approach, more explicit special and differential treatment provisions in specific WTO agreements, and a concerted effort to establish a mechanism in the WTO where development concerns can be considered. A case is made for the latter – involving a serious effort to increase the transparency of applied policies, including assessments of their effectiveness and the magnitude of any negative spillovers imposed on other developing countries.", 01 June 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 2, June 2005, Pages 405–424, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi027
4,Chairing a WTO Negotiation,['John S. Odell'],"Since 1997 efforts by member states of the World Trade Organization to negotiate multilateral decisions, at the ministerial level and below, have been less efficient and less legitimate than many would prefer. Yet proposals for formal changes to decision-making institutions have not achieved consensus. Meanwhile, member states have given a limited role to the chairs of their negotiating bodies to build consensus and mediate deadlocks. Very little has been published describing how chairs perform this function or assessing the effectiveness of different techniques. Research indicates that WTO chairs use three types of mediation tactics. The most passive are observation, diagnosis and communication tactics. Type 2 are called formulation tactics, and occasionally they use the most directive or manipulative tactics. Each type of move raises its own dilemmas for the chair, whose decisions are sometimes controversial. The way these mediators operate may have a significant effect on the likelihood of agreement, the distribution of gains and losses, and the WTO’s legitimacy, even in a famously ‘member-driven’ organization. A review of recent experience points to lessons for future practice and suggests an informal innovation to enhance chairs’ preparation for this task.", 01 June 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 2, June 2005, Pages 425–448, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi028
5,An Analysis of Pascal Lamy’s Proposal on Collective Preferences,['Steve Charnovitz'],"In September 2004, then-European Commissioner for Trade Pascal Lamy released his study on the political challenge of ‘collective preferences’ for the world trading system. Collective preferences cause a problem for the WTO if the resulting measure violates WTO rules and yet the measure is too popular in the regulating country for the government to withdraw it. The paradigmatic example is EC – Hormones in which the European Commission could not comply because of contrary popular and parliamentary opinion. To address such circumstances, Lamy proposes the negotiation of a new WTO safeguard that would permit governments to retain strongly-supported measures provided that compensation is paid. This article analyzes Lamy’s paper and discusses the many challenges to validating a collective preference. The article posits that whether a new safeguard is needed depends in part on the leeway that WTO rules provide for legitimate domestic measures. The article concludes that while Lamy’s purpose may be worthy, his proposal has several weaknesses, and enacting it in the WTO is highly unlikely.", 01 June 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 2, June 2005, Pages 449–472, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi029
6,Counting Regulatory Benefits and Costs: Lessons for the US and Europe,"['Robert W. Hahn', ' Robert E. Litan']","This paper reviews the US and European experiences with regulatory oversight and the use of formal tools to analyze regulation. We conclude that the US and Europe have made some progress in improving regulatory analysis and oversight, but they can do much more.
We offer six recommendations for improving the quality and transparency of regulatory oversight and analysis: three recommendations for the United States and three for Europe. For the US, we suggest that: 1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) apply its in-house expertise to evaluate the costs and benefits of regulations; 2) Congress pass a law requiring that all federal regulatory agencies submit annual cost and benefit estimates of major regulations to OMB; and 3) OMB issue a scorecard assessing the overall quality of regulation and ask the agencies to complete a scorecard for each major regulation.
For Europe, we suggest that: 1) The European Union (EU) pass a directive specifying that the primary objective of regulation is to maximize net benefits; 2) The EU create a strong centralized regulatory oversight unit to help evaluate regulatory proposals; and 3) The EU, as well as each member state, create a structure that is balanced, which promotes efficient regulation and discourages inefficient or ineffective regulation.", 01 June 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 2, June 2005, Pages 473–508, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi030
7,Reform of IMF Conditionality: A Proposal for Self-Imposed Conditionality,['Ofer Eldar'],"The IMF has faced criticism of its expansive use of conditionality. The paper proposes a new procedure for IMF lending designed to meet these criticisms by arguing for the legalization and formalization of the procedure for IMF lending in the light of legal concepts derived mainly from national administrative laws. The gist of the procedure is that, rather than have the IMF determine loan conditions following informal negotiations with member countries, countries seeking Fund assistance will design the conditions themselves. The IMF will have specified powers under which to review these conditions. Apart from other procedural requirements, conditions will have to meet the standard of reasonableness. Subject to reasonableness, the IMF will have to lend on the conditions proposed by the country approaching it. Submissions to the IMF, IMF decisions and the reasons for them will be published. This proposal has many advantages over the current practice. It promotes transparency and accountability of the IMF and the participation of developing countries. It induces countries to initiate effective economic reforms while maintaining their economic sovereignty. Finally, I argue that self-imposed conditionality is not more costly than the current procedure and that legalization and transparency will not disrupt the operation of the IMF.", 01 June 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 2, June 2005, Pages 509–549, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi031
8,Oil and Gas Services: Market Liberalization and the Ongoing GATS Negotiations,"['Irene Musselli', ' Simonetta Zarrilli']","Trade liberalization of oil and gas services is likely to involve three broad sets of issues that may be subject to negotiations. First, it is still rather controversial which economic activities in the hydrocarbon sector might constitute services and might be the object of multilateral trade liberalization. Second, beyond classification difficulties, uncertainty and ambiguities still persist with respect to the scope and content of applicable GATS rules. Finally, specific commitments for oil and gas services may turn out to be of marginal commercial value if they are not underpinned by a set of complementary measures.", 01 June 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 2, June 2005, Pages 551–581, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi032
