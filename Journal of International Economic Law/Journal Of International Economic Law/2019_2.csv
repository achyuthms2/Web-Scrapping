0,WTO Dispute Settlement Post 2019: What to Expect?,['Joost Pauwelyn'],"What does the imminent demise of the WTO Appellate Body (AB) mean for the settlement of ongoing and future trade disputes? This editorial discusses two ‘unlikely solutions’, at least in the short term: the US lifts its veto on AB appointments; a WTO organ unlocks the impasse. Appeals pending on 10 December 2019 will most likely be carried-over pursuant to (contested) Rule 15 of the AB Working Procedures. For panel reports released after that date, four main scenarios emerge: (i) appeals ‘into the void’ blocking the panel report, (ii) no appeal ex post, or ex ante no appeal pacts, (iii) Article 25 appeal arbitration, (iv) ‘floating’ panel reports (interim or final), neither adopted, nor appealed/blocked. The transformation from GATT to WTO took half a century. Regular veto rights in the settlement of trade disputes may be back in a matter of months. It is one thing to lose the AB, quite another to return to pre-WTO dispute settlement where panel outcomes are not automatically binding and power relations play a considerably greater role. At the same time, it would be wrong to equate a (temporary?) return to GATT-style dispute settlement with the collapse of a rules-based WTO system.", 29 October 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 297–321, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz024
1,Trade and Women—Opportunities for Women in the Framework of the World Trade Organization,"['Rohini Acharya', ' Olga Falgueras Alamo', ' Salma Mohamed Thabit Al-Battashi', ' Anoush der Boghossian', ' Naghm Ghei\r\n                                         ...']","Empowering women is a significant step on the road towards achieving sustainable development, one the of the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) main goals. Today, 124 WTO Members and Observers (representing more than 75% of world trade and two-thirds of the WTO membership) support the Buenos Aires Declaration on Trade and Women’s Economic Empowerment endorsed in the margins of the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference, which seeks to remove trade barriers women face and foster their economic empowerment. This Declaration has made the WTO a key contributor, and even a leader, on the issue of women’s empowerment, in support of development and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. At the same time, it is important to note that inclusive trade is, and always has been, at the heart of the WTO’s work.
The paper therefore offers a preliminary analysis of the various areas of the WTO where women considerations can be used to contribute to building a more inclusive trade system, whether through the numerous provisions of the WTO covered agreements or within the ‘policy space’ that currently exists in the WTO framework. By lowering trade barriers, the WTO can help everyone to participate. Supporting the integration of women into international trade is fundamental to ensuring that everyone can reap the benefits of global trade.", 16 October 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 323–354, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz023
2,"To fuse, Not to Fuse, or Simply Confuse? Assessing the Case for Normative Convergence Between Goods and Services Trade Law",['Pierre Sauvé'],Goods and services were separated (politically) at birth when the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations was launched. The goods and services divide reflected in today’s structure of global trade governance has increasingly come into question in a world of cross-border production networks. This begs the question of the desirability and political economy feasibility of fusing the law of goods and services trade into one undifferentiated whole. This paper asks whether the current architectures of multilateral and preferential trade governance are compatible with a world of trade in tasks; whether existing rules offer globally active firms a coherent structure for doing business in a predictable environment; whether it is feasible to redesign the structure and content of existing trade rules to align them to the reality of production fragmentation; and what steps can be envisaged to better align policy with market realities if restructuring prospects appear unfavorable. The paper argues that fusing trade disciplines for goods and services is neither needed nor feasible and may actually deflect attention from a number of worthwhile policy initiatives where more realistic (if never easily secured) prospects of generic rule-making may well exist., 04 September 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 355–371, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz022
3,"Greening the WTO Environmental Goods Agreement, Tariff Concessions, and Policy Likeness","['Petros C Mavroidis', ' Damien J Neven']","This paper considers the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Environmental Goods Agreement agreements, which grant tariff concession through Harmonized System classifications beyond the six-digit level (‘ex outs’) in favour of ‘green’ goods and discuss how these initiatives fit into the WTO legal regime. Even if the practical significance of the APEC agreement should not be overestimated as it involves modest tariff concessions over a subset of goods, which are not heavily traded, these agreements involve a paradigm shift to the extent that they use tariff concessions negotiated on a plurilateral basis as a policy instrument to meet public policy concern, instead of making market access conditional on meeting national regulations. We find that there is a tension between the current definition of likeness for the enforcement of most favoured nation provisions and the use of ex outs and a risk that improved market access for ex outs could be seen a de facto discrimination. One way out of this conundrum is to define likeness in terms of policy rationales.", 02 August 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 373–388, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz018
4,Regulating Cross-Border Data Flows in a Data-Driven World: How WTO Law Can Contribute,"['Andrew D Mitchell', ' Neha Mishra']","While the free cross-border movement of data is essential to many aspects of international trade, several countries have imposed restrictions on these data flows. The pre-internet rules of the World Trade Organization (`WTO') discipline some of these restrictions, but they are insufficient. Unfortunately, so are the electronic commerce chapters in modern preferential trade agreements. This article argues that reformed WTO rules, which take account of the policy challenges of the data-driven economy, are required. These reforms would facilitate internet openness while ensuring consumer and business trust, promoting digital inclusion of developing countries, and incorporating clear exceptions for legitimate domestic policies.", 28 June 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 389–416, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz016
5,Subsidies for Illegal Activities?—Reframing IUU Fishing from the Law Enforcement Perspective,['Jaemin Lee'],"Fisheries subsidies norms and discussions at present are based on the subsidy framework under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. This approach is pertinent vis-à-vis various types of governmental subsidies provided to fisheries industries. It, however, fails to tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, one of the core targets of the fisheries subsidies norms, because few governments ‘subsidize’ illegal activities such as IUU. As far as IUU fishing is concerned, the real challenge is not about subsidies but about how to enforce domestic laws and regulations to punish owners, operators, and fishermen engaged in such illegal activities. Future discussion of fisheries subsidies norms regarding IUU should reflect the law enforcement aspect in addition to the present subsidy aspect.", 28 June 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 417–438, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz017
6,Are Retaliatory Trade Measures Justified under the WTO Agreement on Safeguards?,['Yong-Shik Lee'],"In March 2018, the USA adopted measures to increase tariffs on a range of imported steel and aluminum products, claiming that the measures are justified for its national security concerns. Several World Trade Organization Members, including the European Union, India, Russia, Turkey, and China, have argued that the US measures are in violation of WTO rules on safeguard measures and adopted retaliatory measures invoking Article 12.5 of the Agreement on Safeguards. The USA argues that its measures do not constitute safeguard measures under WTO rules, and, therefore, the retaliatory measures are not justified under the SA. This article reviews relevant cases and examines whether the US measures are safeguard measures under the SA and whether the retaliatory measures are also justified under the SA. The article also discusses the need for regulatory reform to address the issues with unilateral trade measures and retaliation.", 12 April 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 439–458, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz006
7,Challenging Unwritten Measures in the World Trade Organization: The Need for Clear Legal Standards,"['Cherise Valles', ' Vitaliy Pogoretskyy', ' Tatiana Yanguas']","Disputes in the World Trade Organization (WTO) involving the challenge of unwritten measures have increased in recent years. This trend may have been encouraged by the successful challenge of Argentina’s ‘managed trade policy’ as an ‘overarching unwritten measure’ in Argentina—Import Measures. Advancing a claim against an unwritten measure, however, is not an easy undertaking. These measures are not embodied in any law, administrative regulation or judicial decision. Their very existence and precise contours are, therefore, uncertain and must be proven with evidence, which may not necessarily be readily available. The uncertain nature of unwritten measures makes the dispute settlement process significantly more complicated for the complainant, the respondent and the WTO adjudicators. Despite the difficulties in challenging, defending and adjudicating unwritten measures, relatively little has been written on this subject. This article discusses the types of trade concerns that could be challenged as ‘unwritten measures’, and the different legal characterizations (analytical tools) that have been used to challenge these trade concerns in the WTO. The article further explores the practical difficulties that have been encountered in challenges against unwritten measures and how these difficulties have sometimes, but not always, been overcome. The article concludes that there is a lack of clarity as to the correct legal standard that must be applied in the challenge of different types of unwritten measures. There is more work to be done to clarify the applicable legal standards and the types of evidence required to substantiate the existence of unwritten measures.", 14 May 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 459–482, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz007
8,Towards a Coherent Theory of Panel Recommendations for Expired Measures,['Prakhar Bhardwaj'],"Article 19.1 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding provides that if a measure is found to be inconsistent with a WTO Agreement, the Panel or Appellate Body ‘shall recommend that the Member concerned bring the measure into conformity with the agreement’. However, Panels find themselves in a difficult position when the contested measure has expired during the course of proceedings. Since, on the one hand, the measure which would have ordinarily been recommended to be withdrawn is no longer in existence, but on the other hand, they are under an obligation to issue a recommendation as per Article 19.1. Various rationales of the Panels and the Appellate Body for providing recommendations for expired measures (‘EMRs’) have been inconsistent, ad-hoc and even contradictory. Given the different array of approaches adopted, there is no coherent and integrated theory which can be formulated which tells us when and why EMRs should be provided under Article 19.1. This article seeks to bridge this gap. The article also provides a critical analysis of the questionable recommendations issued by the Panel in India – Import of Iron and Steel Products and provides a more coherent framework to guide Panels’ recommendations in relation to expired measures.", 27 September 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 483–502, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz020
9,The CETA Opinion of the European Court of Justice and its Implications—Not that Selfish After All,['Christian Riffel'],"In Opinion 1/17, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) found the investment court system compatible with European Union (EU) law. The ruling concerned the mechanism in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) but the Court’s reasoning is equally applicable to other investment courts as established, for example, in the EU’s investment protection agreements with Singapore and Vietnam. This outcome was far from clear, given that in the past the accession to international dispute settlement bodies regularly foundered on the autonomy of the EU legal order. The present article parses the CETA Opinion and explores its implications. It particularly focuses on autonomy as a constitutional principle and its advancement in Opinion 1/17. Importantly, the ECJ accepted the superiority of a court created by international agreement in relation to the said agreement. Furthermore, it clarified that it is not prerequisite for the Court to rule first on the meaning to be given to an act of EU law before that act can be the subject matter of an investment dispute. Finally, the pdrerogative of the EU to autonomously set the level of protection of a public welfare goal must be secured in a treaty for the EU to join it.", 23 August 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 3, September 2019, Pages 503–521, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz021
