0,Recalibrating the WTO Dispute Settlement System: Towards New Standards of Appellate Review,['Thomas Cottier'],"This paper analyses the legal nature of the dispute settlement system in the World Trade Organization. It places the Panel stage at the heart of it and stresses the crucial role of the World Trade Organization Secretariat. It submits proposals for structural reform. It qualifies Panel reports as a product of a legal agency process in global administrative law. It consequently recalibrates the role of the Appellate Body with a view to bring about checks and balances. This paper explores the neglected role of standards of review of the Appellate Body vis-à-vis Panels. While securing a continued leading role of the Appellate Body on constitutional issues and fundamental principles of the system, it suggests a more deferential standard of reasonableness in reviewing Panel findings on World Trade Organization rules.", 11 May 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 3, September 2021, Pages 515–533, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab024
1,Finding a Rule-Based Solution to the Appellate Body Crisis: Looking Beyond the Multiparty Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement,['Henry Gao'],"The WTO dispute settlement system is in crisis due to the persistent blockage of the appointment of Appellate Body members by the United States. This paper reviews the US criticisms against the Appellate Body and argues that its allegations are unfounded and its approach is wrong. To deal with the US blockage, various proposals have been made, with the most popular being the Multiparty Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement (MPIA) set up by several key Members including the European Union and China. After a thorough analysis of the key features of the MPIA from both theoretical and practical perspectives, this paper argues that the MPIA fails to provide a proper solution to the Appellate Body crisis due to its many defects. Instead, the paper suggests the appointment of Appellate Body members based on majority voting at the General Council. This paper concludes by noting that only such a rule-based solution can not only solve the current Appellate Body crisis but also deter similar attempts to sabotage the WTO dispute settlement system in the future.", 11 October 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 3, September 2021, Pages 534–550, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab031
2,Special and Differential Treatment Under the World Trade Organization: A Legal Typology,"['Vineet Hegde', ' Jan Wouters']","The World Trade Organization (WTO) Secretariat has developed a typology to categorize various Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) provisions in WTO agreements. This typology is based on the aims and intended effects of such provisions. However, it fails to highlight their legal effects. A legal typology is particularly important because the developed Members note that the developing Members have taken advantage of the system through this treatment and intend to abolish SDT for certain advanced developing Members, whereas developing Members have called SDT a non-negotiable and treaty-embedded ‘right’. Moreover, developing Members have called for an effective operation of SDT provisions. These claims give rise to two questions: (i) do SDT provisions provide legal rights to developing Members? (ii) if so, what provisions confer differential treatment rights? In this article we devise a legal typology for SDT by distinguishing the provisions that confer rights and duties from provisions that constitute merely political commitments. We also consider the types, and the scope, of rights and duties that result in a special or differential treatment. Our results, inter alia, highlight that only 21% of SDT provisions oblige developed Members to provide differential treatment to developing Members. The rest are mere best-effort endeavors and political commitments. We provide our observations for this design feature and explain the underlying rationale of developing Members’ position on SDT. Lastly, we provide a blueprint to resolve the North–South deadlock.", 28 September 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 3, September 2021, Pages 551–571, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab033
3,Rethinking the (CP)TPP as a Model for Regulation of Chinese State-Owned Enterprises,['Weihuan Zhou'],"This paper challenges the widespread view that the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) provides the most advanced rules for regulating China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs). It argues that compared to China’s existing World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations, particularly those specifically tailored to it, the CPTPP SOE chapter does not provide more rigorous or workable rules but rather has narrower applications and more carve-outs. More recent US/EU free trade agreements (FTAs) are largely based on the CPTPP SOE chapter. While these FTAs also seek to address some deficiencies in the CPTPP SOE chapter and gradually expand the rules on subsidies and SOEs, the expanded rules are balanced by the inclusion of extensive exceptions. This balanced approach may be used to facilitate multilateral negotiations of SOE rules, but if this approach is adopted, WTO Members will need to be prepared to negotiate with China on replacing the potentially very broad and rigid China-specific WTO rules with more balanced new rules that apply to all members. The likely consequence would be softer rather than stronger disciplines on Chinese SOEs.", 16 September 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 3, September 2021, Pages 572–590, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab030
4,A Path Toward Sustainable Development Along the Belt and Road,['Johanna Aleria P Lorenzo'],"The article scrutinizes the purported synergies between the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by evaluating the transnational legal order regulating environmental and social impacts of BRI economic activities. From the perspective of international law and sustainable development, three problematic features are identified. First, the bilateral character of agreements between China and BRI-participating States produces fragmented and variable sustainability standards. Second, the informality of State-to-State arrangements often hinder parliamentary and public deliberation in host States. Lastly, BRI decision-making processes restrict non-State actor participation and thereby disregard the very communities harmed by infrastructure projects.
To clear its path to sustainability and bring it closer to the UN agenda, BRI’s legal and regulatory framework must become multilateral, transparent, and inclusive. The proposal entails bringing to fore the relevant background international legal norms, especially on environmental, labor, and human rights protection, and consolidating them in a framework agreement that sets minimum sustainability safeguards for transboundary economic activities like foreign-funded infrastructure projects. Reforms are imperative because the subject matter of the Initiative requires international cooperation and involves not only the economic, environmental, and social concerns of two States but also implicates the goals and interests of the international community.", 25 September 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 3, September 2021, Pages 591–608, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab032
5,Investor–State Mediation and the Belt and Road Initiative: Examining the Conditions for Settlement,['Mark McLaughlin'],"Despite the dominance of arbitration in the realm of investor-state disputes, the variety of proposals for reform suggest considerable stakeholder discontent with the current framework. One suggested reform is the introduction of investor–state mediation, which has been supported by the conclusion of the Singapore Convention on Mediation and the proposal by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) of a set of mediation rules. This article examines the respective merits of arbitration and mediation to settle investment disputes related to the Belt and Road Initiative. Many of the principles underpinning the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative sit uncomfortably alongside an adversarial adjudicative mechanism, and access to arbitration is limited in some investment treaties. It is argued that, in some instances, mediation may be more attuned to the unique conditions of the Belt and Road Initiative. Stakeholders have done considerable work to enhance the legitimacy of mediation within the field of investor–state dispute settlement, but it remains dormant in practice and comparatively rare within investment treaties. While a mediated settlement will remain elusive in many instances, it can be encouraged by a series of reforms to treaty drafting, the internal organization of government departments, and the actions of foreign investors.", 25 August 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 3, September 2021, Pages 609–629, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab028
6,Leveling the Field Through Transnational Regulation,['Kishanthi Parella'],"This paper identifies factors that may lead transnational companies to support transnational regulation in order to level the field between themselves and their rivals when they confront an uneven field produced by either public regulation or private governance. Transnational regulation offers these companies a means to reduce competitive losses by distributing compliance costs to rivals. Differential regulation is necessary but insufficient to result in corporate advocacy for an international agreement or other forms of transnational regulation. Instead, other factors influence the strength or weakness of those preferences for transnational regulation, such as (i) the extent of global footprint, (ii) the net gain or loss resulting from heightened compliance costs, (iii) targets and mechanisms for regulatory change, (iv) market participant profiles, (v) stakeholder characteristics, and (vi) a company’s susceptibility to private governance.", 25 June 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 3, September 2021, Pages 630–648, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab026
7,The Tuna Bond Scandal: The Continued Lack of Transparency in Bank-to-State Credit Facilities Agreements,['Stephen Connelly'],"The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Principles on Promoting Responsible Sovereign Lending and Borrowing provide inter alia that creditors should ensure debt contracts are duly authorized; yet, the Mozambique Tuna Bond Scandal suggests that in the market for private bank-to-state credit facilities agreements, there is still work to do. This article presents empirical evidence suggesting growth in the amount of private bank-to-state loans and argues that this growth, combined with a lack of transparency, will lead to increasing numbers of legal disputes over want and abuse of official authority. The English law doctrines of ultra vires contracting in private international law and abuse of agent authority, usually applied in the context of corruption, are considered, and various reforms are proposed, including a transparency register and a legislative reversal of presumption of agent authority.", 04 September 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 3, September 2021, Pages 649–671, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab029
