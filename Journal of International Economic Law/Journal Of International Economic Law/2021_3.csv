0,Compensation and its Limits: Can Trade’s Losers be Made Whole?,['Kevin Kolben'],"Free trade and global economic integration has been under pressure from populist political movements across the globe. Many of the critiques of trade relate to the losses, both economic and non-economic, that trade’s losers suffer. Many economists and trade lawyers consider the case for free trade to be unassailable and rely on the compensation principle to argue that trade is welfare maximizing if trade’s losers could be compensated such that each is as least as well off as they were before. As a corollary, they will argue that the losers of trade should be compensated for their losses through, for example, direct payments, wage insurance, job retraining, or other supports. It is further assumed that such compensation will boost support for liberal trade policy. This article argues, however, that compensation is conceptually and practically limited in its ability to in fact make trade’s losers whole and is a poor tool to build support for free trade and address the plight of trade’s losers. Instead, it is suggested that broadly targeted non-trade specific programs are preferable, as well as perhaps a reconsideration of the purpose of safeguard measures such that they may be explicitly applied in order to mitigate political opposition to trade rather than only when industries are under threat.", 29 November 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 4, December 2021, Pages 683–702, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab041
1,Government Bailouts of Airlines in the COVID-19 Crisis: Improving Transparency in International Air Transport,['Jae Woon Lee'],"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents the airline industry with unprecedented challenges that constitute no less than an existential threat. Given airlines’ importance in the economy, which includes providing connectivity, preserving jobs, and supporting related sectors, many governments have given local airlines enormous financial support since early 2020. Although it is well understood why many governments cannot allow their major airlines to shut down, the ongoing massive government bailouts can distort competition in the airline industry. This article analyzes various government bailouts of airlines in the COVID-19 crisis and discusses how these bailouts are creating a growing problem with fair competition in the international air transport market. While examining the unique regulatory framework of international air transport, the article recommends multilateral, bilateral, and unilateral rule-based approaches that can better serve economic governance of international air transport in the post-COVID-19 era. Although this article does not suggest major legal reforms, which would be too ambitious and unrealistic at this stage, transparency can be significantly improved through the recommendations provided here.", 18 November 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 4, December 2021, Pages 703–723, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab035
2,Three Decades of the Nakajima Doctrine in EU Law: Where Are We Now?,['Kristiyan Stoyanov'],"Under the Nakajima doctrine, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) can review the legality of a European Union (EU) measure in the light of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements if the EU legislature intended to implement a particular obligation assumed in the context of those agreements. This article argues that Nakajima remains a valid exception to the lack of direct effect of WTO law in the EU. Section II highlights the CJEU’s restrictive interpretation of Nakajima. Section III shows that in recent case law the CJEU continues to take a narrow interpretation of Nakajima, although the CJEU has been reluctant to abolish it altogether. This section also analyses the feasibility of establishing the intention to implement WTO law based on external circumstances (Section III.B) and demonstrates Nakajima’s significance beyond EU law (Section III.C). Section IV criticizes the CJEU’s combination of Nakajima and the principle of interpreting EU law in consistency with international law. Section V concludes.", 14 December 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 4, December 2021, Pages 724–737, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab042
3,The (In)visible Woman at the International Monetary Fund: Engendering National Economic Rule-making,['Camila Villard Duran'],"For decades, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was silent about gender inequality. In 2013, the IMF finally adopted a discourse linking macroeconomic stability and gender inequality. Engendering means the integration of gender equality into the IMF’s activities, thus, generating change. By deploying different institutional mechanisms (e.g. the Article IV reports and conditionality in exchange for financial support), the IMF is contributing to engendering economic rulemaking process at the national level. Discourses matter. Economic laws at national level are shaped by the IMF’s ideas: the meaning-making process of rules at the global level is an integral part of the economic rulemaking process at the national level. Particularly, legal ideas are key to explain the structure of the IMF’s discourse and its potential to promote gender equality. The IMF is an important case study to understand the mechanisms of engendering international organizations with important repercussions for other international institutions.", 27 November 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 4, December 2021, Pages 738–754, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab037
4,The Curious Case of Stablecoins—Balancing Risks and Rewards?,['Agata Ferreira'],"Stablecoins is a blockchain-driven innovation and a new subset of crypto assets. Even though they could transform how payments are made, regulators paid little attention to them until recently. The announcement of the Libra project in 2019 elevated stablecoins to the top of the regulatory agenda. Libra’s global scale and its capacity to reach billions of potential users through a user-centric social network platform that is already seamlessly integrated within the lives of the global population and the potential impact of a global yet fast and cheap payment solution raised many issues and concerns among authorities related to not only financial stability, monetary policy, and competition, but also money laundering, financing of terrorism, and others. Addressing stablecoins has proven challenging for many regulators as they face a difficult task of balancing financial stability, with innovation. This paper analyzes how the official perception of stablecoins has evolved, from dismissiveness and underestimation to serious concern. It evaluates existing regulatory responses, highlights regulatory dilemmas, and makes recommendations regarding future regulatory approaches. To reap the benefits of stablecoin innovation, regulators need to take a broader long-term view of stablecoins beyond the perceived risks and embrace their advantages. Regulations should not stifle this innovation but support a diverse ecosystem of stablecoins and foster competition.", 30 November 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 4, December 2021, Pages 755–778, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab036
5,Policy Space for Capital Flow Management: An Empirical Investigation,"['Rachel D Thrasher', ' Sarah Sklar', ' Kevin P Gallagher']","Many in the academic community have identified that some trade and investment treaties restrict the ability of nation states to regulate volatile capital flows to prevent and mitigate financial instability. This paper quantifies the variation across preferential and free trade agreements with respect to their policy space for capital flow management measures. With these data we create a composite score of treaty flexibility and examine the collective level of policy space across the global trade regime. We find that the majority of trade treaties leave significant policy space for regulating cross-border finance in the world economy. South-South treaties tend to have the most policy space, whereas North-South and North-North treaties have less. When weighted by the level of gross domestic product (GDP) and incoming foreign investment however, we find that those treaties with the least amount of policy space for capital flow measures represent 65% of world GDP and 48% of global capital flows. What is more, it appears that the global trend is toward treaties without the policy space for appropriate regulation.", 10 December 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 4, December 2021, Pages 779–798, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab040
