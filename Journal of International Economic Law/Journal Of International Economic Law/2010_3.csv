0,Binding Tariff Preferences for Developing Countries Under Article II Gatt,"['Lorand Bartels', ' Christian Häberli']","Tariff preferences, which are authorized under the WTO Enabling Clause and autonomous waivers, are often withdrawn on dubious grounds and without due process. This reduces much of their potential value, because traders and investors lack the predictability and security necessary to make long-term business decisions based on the market access opportunities that these preferences provide. Some developing countries have responded to this by concluding regional trade agreements (RTAs) under Article XXIV of the GATT, despite the sometimes heavy price of reciprocity. In this article, we offer an alternative. We make two practical proposals to provide the maximum possible security and predictability for both preference beneficiaries and donors. First, we argue that, contrary to what is often assumed, it is perfectly possible to bind tariff preferences under existing WTO rules. Second, based upon an examination of the current state of the law, we propose that any withdrawals of products and countries from tariff preference programs, whether by way of temporary safeguards or definitive ‘graduation’, should be based on objective and legally secure criteria. These criteria should also be scheduled as qualifications to bound preferences under Article II of the GATT. These reforms are possible without any change to existing WTO rules.", 20 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 4, December 2010, Pages 969–995, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq051
1,China’s Development of International Economic Law and WTO Legal Capacity Building,['Pasha L. Hsieh'],"This article examines legal and institutional aspects of the evolution of China’s approach to the dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It begins by analyzing the impact of China’s changing attitude toward international law on the escalation of international economic law research. In particular, the article provides the first detailed examination of China’s efforts to strengthen public–private cooperation in building its WTO legal capacity. China established think tanks to bridge the information and communication gaps between the government and industries. To develop its WTO lawyers, the Chinese government has consistently required international law firms to collaborate with domestic firms in major disputes and engaged the latter in third-party cases. Finally, the article evaluates China’s assertive legalism strategy that enhances its recent participation in WTO rule-making and disputes against the US and the European Union. This research, therefore, provides a valuable case study for other emerging economies and the multilateral trading system.", 14 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 4, December 2010, Pages 997–1036, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq047
2,The Quest for Policy Space in a New Generation of International Investment Agreements,['Suzanne A. Spears'],"One of the most important challenges facing the international investment law regime today is how to strike a balance between principles regarding the protection and promotion of foreign investment on the one hand and principles regarding the protection of society and the environment on the other. A number of states have made significant progress towards meeting that challenge by adding interpretive provisions, general exceptions clauses and new preambular language to a new-generation of international investment agreements (IIAs). If the serious substantive and procedural questions they raise can be answered satisfactorily, these new treaties may go a long way towards saving the international investment law from the legitimacy crisis it is currently experiencing.", 20 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 4, December 2010, Pages 1037–1075, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq048
3,Autonomy in Setting Appropriate Level of Protection under the WTO Law: Rhetoric or Reality?,['Michael Ming Du'],"In the World Trade Organization (WTO) jurisprudence, the Appellate Body (AB) has repeatedly affirmed that WTO Members have the prerogative right in setting any level of protection that they deem appropriate (ALOP). At the same time, WTO Agreements provide for disciplines that a WTO Member must respect when it selects regulatory measures to fulfill its ALOP. Thus, a WTO Member’s autonomy in setting its ALOP, on the one hand, and the full force of other disciplines, on the other hand, are in a constant state of tension. Then, exactly how does a panel balance a Member’s right of setting its ALOP with a myriad of other trade obligations? To what extent is this right respected in the WTO dispute settlement processes? This article argues that the case law has confirmed that a Member’s obligations under the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) must be read in light of the Member’s chosen ALOP, and that the AB has also demonstrated sensitivity and deference to a Member’s ALOP under the SPS Agreement. The same conclusion, however, cannot be easily applied to Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994). Indeed, the case law under Article XX has demonstrated inconsistencies as to when WTO Members’ right to set their ALOP will be respected. I argue that such inconsistencies may be explained by a value-based, pragmatic approach adopted by the AB.", 15 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 4, December 2010, Pages 1077–1102, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq050
4,Less than the Gats: ‘Negative Preferences’ in Regional Services Agreements,"['Rudolf Adlung', ' Peter Morrison']","Regional trade agreements in services are a relatively recent, but rapidly expanding phenomenon. Their relationship with commitments undertaken under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) or offered in the Doha Round has attracted some attention in the literature. Relevant publications tend to focus on the ‘value added’ that such agreements might generate through broader sectoral coverage or deeper levels of liberalization. This article takes a different perspective, however, and focuses on provisions that fall short of the same countries’ GATS commitments. Such ‘negative preferences’ are more than an isolated occurrence: they can be found in most recent agreements, including agreements involving some of the largest World Trade Organization (WTO) Members. The existence of ‘negative preferences’ or ‘GATS-minus commitments’ may prove relevant for several reasons: in particular, they could impinge on an agreement’s legal status under the GATS and help create a trading system beyond the WTO. It is conceivable that such minus-commitments are mutually conceded in ‘sensitive’ sectors or tacitly accepted in view of ‘side-payments’ in non-WTO currency (including development finance). Those who subscribe to Bhagwati’s comparison of PTAs with termites might thus have additional reason to be alarmed: the bugs’ unconventional table manners.", 07 September 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 4, December 2010, Pages 1103–1143, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq021
