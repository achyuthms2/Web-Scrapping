0,Rule-making in the WTO: lessons from the case of bribery and corruption,['KW Abbott'],"During the 1990s, the OECD and numerous other international organizations adopted conventions and other instruments designed to control bribery and corruption in international business. The WTO, however, took no such action, and a related initiative on transparency in government procurement has not yet produced any results. This article examines what one can learn about rule-making in the WTO from its failure to act in this case. Much of the explanation for the inaction lay outside the organization, in the political incentives facing major actors. Yet structural characteristics of the WTO, its approach to legalization, and its negotiating processes also played significant roles. These factors should be addressed if the organization is to deal effectively with the controversial issues now on its agenda.", 01 June 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 2, June 2001, Pages 275–296, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.2.275
1,The process of China's accession to the WTO,"['Y Guohua', ' C Jin']","Accession to the WTO is one of the most important events for China at present. This paper begins by narrating the historical facts of China's legacy as one of the original contracting parties of the GATT - recounting the more than 50-year relations between China and the GATT/WTO, analyzing the 15-year negotiations concerning China's resumption of membership in the GATT and its accession to the WTO, and scrutinizing the factors involved in a comprehensive way. This piece ends with some of our own views about the work China continues to be confronted with in its accession to the WTO.", 01 June 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 2, June 2001, Pages 297–328, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.2.297
2,Regional trade integration in the Americas during the 1990s: reflections of some trends and their implication for the multilateral trade system,['R Echandi'],"This article presents an analytical overview of the process of regional trade integration in the Americas during the 1990s. By focusing on some particular trends inferred from the process as a whole, the article argues that regional trade agreements can fulfill economic, political, and legal objectives that are extremely unlikely to be attainable by the multilateral trading system alone. Thus, it is suggested that the experience of regionalism in the Americas during the last decade illustrates how regionalism can complement multilateralism in order to foster trade liberalization.", 01 June 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 2, June 2001, Pages 367–410, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.2.367
3,"Legal persuasion, political realism, and legitimacy: the European Court's recent treatment of the effect of WTO agreements in the EC legal order",['N van den Broek'],"Within the scope of Community law, the European Court of Justice denies both Members States and private parties the right to rely directly on provisions of WTO agreements. Its reasoning, as formulated in Portugal/Council (November 1999) and now confirmed in Dior/Tuk (December 2000) rests on a distinction made between the WTO agreements, based on the principle of negotiations 'based on reciprocity and mutual advantages', and other international treaties.
This article argues that the nature and reciprocity of the WTO agreements do not distinguish them from other treaties in a way that justifies denial of direct effect. Compensation and suspension of obligations are temporary and unilateral rights, not legal options for the defendant. The WTO in fact codifies and restricts the role of negotiations.
It may, however, be wise to deny direct effect, because there is a conflict between the predominant realist approach to international relations and allowing private parties to invoke certain international rules. But it is not for the Court to take such a political decision. Also, denying Member States the possibility of invoking WTO provisions deprives Articles 230 and 300(7) EC of all meaning and the EC, the adolescent international leviathan, is left almost without judicial control in the area of international trade.", 01 June 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 2, June 2001, Pages 411–440, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.2.411
