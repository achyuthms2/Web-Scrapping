0,Trade versus Culture in the Digital Environment: An Old Conflict in Need of a New Definition,['Mira Burri-Nenova'],"Following the recent UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, the first wave of scholarly work has focused on clarifying the interface between the Convention and the WTO Agreements. Building upon these analyses, the present article takes however a different stance. It seeks a new, rather pragmatic definition of the relationship between trade and culture and argues that such a re-definition is particularly needed in the digital networked environment that has modified the ways markets for cultural content function and the ways in which cultural content is created, distributed and accessed. The article explores first the significance of the UNESCO Convention (or the lack thereof) and subsequently outlines a variety of ways in which the WTO framework can be improved in a ‘neutral’, not necessarily culturally motivated, manner to become more conducive to the pursuit of cultural diversity and taking into account the changed reality of digital media. The article also looks at other facets of the profoundly fragmented culture-related regulatory framework and underscores the critical importance of intellectual property rights and of other domains that appear at first sight peripheral to the trade and culture discussion, such as access to infrastructure, interoperability or net neutrality. It is argued that a number of feasible solutions exist beyond the politically charged confrontation of trade versus culture and that the new digital media landscape may require a readjustment of the priorities and the tools for the achievement of the widely accepted objective of cultural diversity.", 26 November 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 1, March 2009, Pages 17–62, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn038
1,How Much Credit for Export Credit Support Under the SCM Agreement?,['Dominic Coppens'],"This contribution examines the degree of policy space the WTO leaves its Members to support export credits for non-agricultural goods. In the light of existing case law, it illustrates that export credit support offered by export credit agencies that aims at complementing the private trade finance market would in principle be prohibited under the SCM Agreement. However, while some low-income countries can rely on a specific exception on the prohibition on export subsidies, all WTO Members can, on the basis of the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies, justify certain subsidized export credits that are in accordance with the interest rate provisions of the OECD Arrangement. But, as the case law and the OECD Arrangement currently stand, subsidized export credit guarantees and insurance as well as subsidized short-term export credits cannot rely on this safe haven. Hence, the article shows that export credit agencies, except for those of some low-income countries, cannot play a complementary role to the private market in offering such support. Moreover, this contribution demonstrates that export credit support in accordance with the safe haven might still be countervailable and actionable. Finally, it is argued that an exception which can be modified by a subgroup of WTO Members, like the safe haven, can no longer be accepted.", 04 February 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 1, March 2009, Pages 63–113, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn041
2,The Forest for the Trees: A Roadmap to Canada's Litigation Experience in Lumber IV,['David Quayat'],"The ongoing feud over the export of Canadian softwood lumber to the US is likely one of the most litigated trade disputes in history. In April 2001, the fourth round of the lumber dispute commenced. The ensuing five-and-a-half years featured a number of cases being filed before panels constituted under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as, for the first time, US domestic courts. During the summer of 2006, as with the two rounds of the dispute immediately before it, Canada and the US negotiated a settlement. This article presents a broad overview of the softwood lumber dispute and examines what was accomplished in the Lumber IV litigation. It explores the decisions rendered by NAFTA and WTO panels, as well as the historic foray by Canadian parties into the US courts. It also analyses lessons learned from the softwood lumber litigation, and the potential applicability of these lessons to other complex trade disputes.", 04 February 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 1, March 2009, Pages 115–151, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn040
3,"Necessity Exceptions in WTO Law: Retreaded Tyres, Regulatory Purpose and Cumulative Regulatory Measures",['Benn McGrady'],"The recent decisions of the panel and Appellate Body in Brazil – Measures Affecting Imports of Retreaded Tyres touched upon a number of issues of ongoing significance to the application of necessity tests, such as those in Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This article argues that the dispute represents a mixed outcome for the application of necessity tests. The express recognition that some regulatory measures are complementary to one another rather than reasonably available alternatives constitutes a welcome step forward. On the other hand, the panel's characterization of Brazil's regulatory goal highlights an approach common to a number of panel reports that could justify a perception of arbitrariness in application of necessity tests. Similarly, comments made by the Appellate Body to the effect that a panel is obliged to consider the importance of a state's regulatory goal extend the role of a panel in an unjustifiable manner.", 15 December 2008,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 1, March 2009, Pages 153–173, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgn039
