0,Dispute settlement in international economic law - lessons for strengthening international dispute settlement in non-economic areas,['E-U Petersmann'],"This article begins with a discussion of negotiation theories and the need for a comprehensive theory of effective international adjudication and then examines why compulsory international adjudication is more widely accepted in international economic law and in related regional integration law than in non-economic areas of international law. The article compares the relevant dispute settlement mechanisms and offers economic, political and legal reasons why legal remedies and international adjudication tend to be more effective in international economic law than in other areas of international law. Lessons are drawn from the 'international economic law revolution', and concrete proposals are made for strengthening international dispute settlement mechanisms in non-economic areas, notably in UN law. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) and other UN dispute settlement mechanisms (notably in UN human rights covenants) risk coming under increasing criticism unless they protect human rights and rule of law more effectively. The power-oriented UN legal system requires far-reaching constitutional reforms.", 01 June 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 2, June 1999, Pages 189–248, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.2.189
1,The United Nations Compensation Commission: A new contribution to the process of international claims resolution,['N Wühler'],"The United Nations Compensation Commission is one of the many bodies that have over recent years contributed to the proliferation of claims resolution and dispute settlement facilities. The Commission has been set up by the UN Security Council to process claims and pay compensation for direct losses resulting from Iraq's 1990 invasion and subsequent occupation of Kuwait. While the Commission is in many respects in the tradition of international claims practice, there are other features that make it a novel and unprecedented scheme. In particular, the UNCC represents the first attempt of the international community to organize a claims resolution process through a multilateral facility within the UN system. In addition, the large number of claims, the size and variety of the losses and damages and the complexity of the process have required an organization and procedures that have developed modern international claims practice further, especially with respect to the methods and techniques used for the processing of the claims. This article focuses on these procedural aspects of the Commission's work and on the issues and challenges that are facing the Commission and that others may face in the future.", 01 June 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 2, June 1999, Pages 249–272, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.2.249
2,The settlement of disputes within the International Labour Office,['F Maupain'],"Since its creation in 1919, the ILO has had two constitutional procedures for the settlement of disputes relating to the implementation of Conventions by states which have ratified them: an informal and 'political' representation procedure (ILO Constitution Article 24) and a more formal, judicial complaint procedure (Article 26). These constitutional procedures have been complemented by the ILO's establishment, at an early stage (1926), of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. That Committee whose reports are discussed in the International Labour Conference, plays a key role in practice. More recently (1950), the ILO established a Committee on Freedom of Association with jurisdiction to consider complaints in the area of freedom of association, even in cases where the state complained against has not ratified the relevant conventions. With their diversity and their complementarity, these procedures have a unique feature in common: the role and responsibilities that they give to non-governmental actors (employers' and workers' organizations). Disputes relating to the interpretation of conventions and of the ILO Constitution itself are subject to different procedures which, though refinements have been introduced in the interim, have not been used since World War II.", 01 June 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 2, June 1999, Pages 273–293, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.2.273
3,WTO dispute settlement practice relating to the GATS,['W Zdouc'],"This paper discusses how the GATS adapts the different stages of the WTO dispute settlement procedures as foreseen by the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) to trade in services. It deals with (1) bilateral and multilateral confutations, (2) causes of action in the adjudicative stage, (3) implementation and enforcement under surveillance by the DSB, and (4) special procedures for particular service sectors. It also explains the nine violation cases that were initiated between 1995 and 1998. Taking the EC - Bananas case as an example, the paper then discusses those legal issues and problems that are also likely to arise in future cases under the GATS. A discussion of the national treatment clause follows, addressing in particular the reach of de jure and de facto discrimination under the GATS, as well as the irrelevance of the 'aims and effects' of national regulation, and evidentiary problems arising in GATS dispute settlement practice. The final section deals with the reach of de jure and de facto discrimination under the GATS MFN treatment clause.", 01 June 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 2, June 1999, Pages 295–346, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.2.295
4,WTO dispute settlement practice relating to the trips agreement,"['M Geuze', ' H Wager']","This paper provides some statistical information on the 16 TRIPS disputes initiated to date and discusses the Panel and Appellate Body Reports issued and adopted to date. Some of the procedural issues that have arisen are addressed, but the main focus is on the interpretation of the TRIPS provisions in question and the interpretative issues that the Panels and the Appellate Body were faced with, and how the Panels and the Appellate Body approached the questions raised. Information is also provided about a pending panel procedure, the mutually agreed solutions reached to date and the pending consultations. Finally, dispute prevention under the TRIPS Agreement and the role of the review of implementing legislation in the Council for TRIPS in this connection is addressed.", 01 June 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 2, June 1999, Pages 347–384, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.2.347
