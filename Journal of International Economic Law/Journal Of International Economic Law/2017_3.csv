0,International Investment Law through the Lens of Global Justice,['Steven R Ratner'],"The last decade has witnessed a series of criticisms from states, NGOs, and scholars of international investment law’s rules and procedures. Running in parallel, and for a longer period, political philosophers have developed theories about what would constitute a just international economic order. Yet international law and philosophy have not directly engaged with one another regarding the justice of international investment law. This article attempts to breach that gap by analyzing the key critiques of investment law from the perspective of theories of global justice. Philosophical approaches are useful for appraising investment law because they offer a rigorous framework for thinking carefully about where investment law should be going; because rules that align with our sense of justice are more likely to be respected; and because these inquiries force lawyers to be more honest about the moral assumptions they already make in defending or attacking international investment law. Two of the main critiques of investment law—a systemic critique and a policy-space critique—are analyzed from the perspective of distributive justice. A third, institutional, critique is examined from perspectives within legal philosophy concerning procedural justice and the rule of law. The piece concludes with a series of suggestions for integrating the legal and philosophical discussions regarding investment law.", 01 March 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2017, Pages 747–775, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgx038
1,The Use of Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses to Import Substantive Treaty Provisions in International Investment Agreements,['Facundo Pérez-Aznar'],"The present work considers the use of Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) clauses within Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs), or other International Investment Agreements (IIAs), to import provisions, not included in the IIA (such as fair and equitable treatment provisions or umbrella clauses), by investment arbitral tribunals. Many tribunals have allowed the use of MFN clauses for this purpose, imported the absent standard in the treaty, and have subsequently considered whether or not there was compliance with the imported provision. This study analyses whether this is a proper use of MFN clauses in IIAs. It first examines the practice of some investment tribunals of importing substantive provisions through MFN clauses. Secondly, it analyses whether MFN clauses can be used to import a substantive provision in order to include a new obligation and, at the same time, confer jurisdiction to decide on breaches of imported provisions. In doing so it explores the nature, scope, and limits of MFN clauses as well as the principle of consent to international jurisdiction. Thirdly, it considers how tribunals should proceed when faced with this type of argument, focusing on the interpretation of the elements of MFN clauses. It is suggested that typical MFN clauses included in IIAs should not be used to import treaty provisions.", 22 January 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2017, Pages 777–805, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgx034
2,Implementing the No Harm Principle in International Economic Law: A Comparison Between Measure-Based Rules and Effect-Based Rules,['Jelena Bäumler'],"The regulatory nature of measure-based rules is distinctively different from that of effect-based rules. While a breach of a measure-based rule is determined by the actual measure, in effect-based rules a breach is to be determined against the actual effects of the measure. Effect-based rules can be regarded as implementing the no harm principle that proscribes measures to cause adverse effects to other states, while seeking to reconcile colliding interests on a practical level and taking into account the detrimental effects created for others. Measure-based rules, being the norm in the jurisprudence of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) are to be examined by panels and the Appellate Body in light of the ‘architecture, structure and design’ of a measure: it is not necessary to demonstrate the occurrence of adverse effects. In contrast, the regulatory framework dealing with the harmful effect of measures is located, especially, in the rules governing non-violation complaints and within the rules on actionable subsidies. While most WTO obligations may clearly be categorized as either measure- or effect-based rules, certain rules or at least their interpretation seem to blur the line between these two categories. This article examines and discusses both regulatory types and ultimately argues that, while measure-based rules provide for more regulatory stringency, effect-based rules leave greater policy-space and can succeed in breaking deadlocks in negotiations under certain circumstances. In such circumstances, they may therefore support the further development of certain yet under-regulated areas of international economic law.", 29 January 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2017, Pages 807–828, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy001
3,What use is an unloaded gun? The substantive discipline of the WTO TBT Code of Good Practice and its application to private standards pursuing public objectives,['Enrico Partiti'],"The proliferation and diffusion of private standards in the domain of social and environmental sustainability has raised a host of complex questions concerning the role that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the WTO Agreements should play vis-à-vis private standards affecting trade. While a common approach has been the claim of regulatory space for such private standards, this article attempts to take stock of the underdevelopment of the provisions of the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement addressing standards, and in particular the TBT Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards. It clarifies the scope of application of the TBT Code and the extent of the obligation imposed on WTO Members to ensure that private standards are in compliance with its requirements. It subsequently attempts to interpret the TBT Code’s crucial provisions of non-discrimination, necessity and to base standards on international standards, in a manner that mediates between private autonomy, and the need to ensure that the most serious trade restrictive effects of private standards pursuing public policy objectives are remedied.", 01 March 2017,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2017, Pages 829–854, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgx039
4,"Seeds, Trade, Trust: Regionalization Commitments under the SPS Agreement",['Naoto Nelson Saika'],"Most of the disciplines set out in WTO agreements anticipate nationwide trade measures. Article 6 of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures is one of a few provisions that explicitly refers to region-based trade measures. This article explores Article 6 by reviewing relevant negotiation history, roles of international organizations, and case law (India – Agricultural Products, US – Animals, and Russia – Pigs (EU)). In addition, to further explore the topic, this article provides a consistency analysis of a specific measure implemented by Japan against wheat shipped from the USA amid detections of unauthorized genetically modified wheat in the USA. Unique features of plant trade that need to be taken into account when applying Article 6 will be introduced throughout this article.", 17 February 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2017, Pages 855–881, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy002
5,Export Restrictions in Plant Breeder's Rights,['Matthew Kennedy'],This article exposes a conflict between UPOV (1991) and GATT 1994. UPOV (1991) provides for the grant of an exclusive exportation right over plant and other material and for the revival of this right after exhaustion. The exclusive exportation right constitutes an export restriction inconsistent with Article XI:1 of GATT 1994 that lacks a justification in Article XX(d) or any other GATT exception. Many WTO Members join UPOV (1991) as a means of implementing a TRIPS obligation but TRIPS neither requires nor authorizes the grant of exclusive exportation rights inconsistent with GATT 1994. Certain free trade agreements do require ratification of UPOV (1991) but paradoxically reiterate the obligation in Article XI:1 of GATT 1994 as well. The article concludes that laws providing for exclusive exportation rights for plant breeders are vulnerable to challenge in the WTO dispute settlement mechanism., 24 January 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2017, Pages 883–903, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgx035
6,The United Kingdom’s Post-Brexit Trade Regime with the European Union and the Rest of the World: Perspectives and Constraints,['Giorgio Sacerdoti'],"The preliminary agreement reached by the UK with the EU in December 2017 has clarified that a “hard” Brexit will most likely be avoided. Negotiations on post-Brexit relations will start early 2018 and a transition period of two years following the UK exit form the EU at the end of March 2019 will maintain the UK in the EU Single Market and Custom Union. The nature of the ‘close partnership’ to be maintained thereafter between the two parties is however still to be elaborated since the UK has signaled that it does not intend to remain part of either, while maintaining a ‘regulatory alignment’ such as to avoid reestablishing of a border within Ireland. At the same time, the UK intends to be able to freely negotiate free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries. Establishing a trade regime ‘as frictionless as possible’ as aimed at by the UK appears therefore problematic. The article discusses first the features of a possible EU-UK post-Brexit FTA, and of reciprocal trade relations in the light of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The Frontier Traffic exception of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article XXIV.3 could be a basis for avoiding reestablishing a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, as both parties aim at, by establishing a special free trade regime between the two parts of the island. As to the existing trade and economic cooperation agreements of the EU with third countries, of which the UK benefits as a member of the Union, their political and economic context and the principles of state succession to treaties speak against the possibility of the UK remaining a party, even if it so wished. The UK exit from the EU may even justify a non-EU party asking for renegotiation if a fundamental change in the trade balance would result therefrom. As to UK’s relations with other WTO members, the UK will retain its status as a full ‘original’ member of the WTO. Its schedule of concessions will be initially that of the EU in place at the date of Brexit. A delicate issue is represented however by the apportionment between the EU and the UK of EU tariff-rate quotas for agricultural products, which will imply negotiations with third countries beneficiaries. Finally, the UK will be able after Brexit to freely negotiate FTAs with any WTO member, notably with the USA. If such agreements will however contain terms not aligned with the EU custom regime and its internal market standards, the UK will face obstacles in accessing the EU market. The UK will thus be faced with difficult trade-offs, considering that the EU market absorbs about 45% of the UK’s goods export, not to speak of its importance for the UK’s financial and other services.", 01 March 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2017, Pages 905–926, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgx040
7,Why Is There So Little Litigation under Free Trade Agreements? Retaliation and Adjudication in International Dispute Settlement,['Geraldo Vidigal'],"Over the past decade, the WTO dispute settlement system has continued to be used extensively, contrasting with the very few disputes taken to inter-state adjudication under free trade agreements (FTAs). This article examines disputes brought to the WTO in 2007-2016 by Members that are also parties to FTAs. Besides specific procedural difficulties in some FTAs, a broader, systemic factor may explain the little resort to FTA dispute settlement: the absence of the collective dynamic that the DSU creates in WTO dispute settlement. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, retaliation is disciplined and limited, rather than enabled, by trade agreements. Even when formally prohibited, the option to retaliate not only remains alive but is widely reported as having been used in a number of cases. The article argues that, while the WTO remedy of retaliation may be useful as a last resort, the primary utility of adjudication for a complainant lies elsewhere. Adjudication operates as an alternative to retaliation: its added value is provided by the reputational damage, and collective pressure for compliance, that a condemnatory WTO ruling generates. Thus, Members resort to adjudication not in order to retaliate, but to avoid resort to mutually harmful retaliation. An assessment of the practice of WTO dispute settlement between DS1 and DS386 (US – COOL), the last dispute to have reached the retaliation stage, demonstrates that Members settle the vast majority of disputes far before lawful retaliation becomes a concrete threat, and prefer adjudication to retaliation even after the latter is authorized. If this assessment is correct, the little use of FTA adjudication may be explained in part by the fact that, in this absence of collective pressure, an aggrieved party may favor over FTA adjudication not only WTO adjudication but also unilateral retaliation.", 17 February 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2017, Pages 927–950, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgx037
8,Old Wine in a New Bottle: The EU’s Response to the Expiry of Section 15(a)(ii) of China’s WTO Protocol of Accession,['Andrei Suse'],"Following the expiry, on 11 December 2016, of the second paragraph of section 15(a) of China’s Protocol of Accession to the WTO, importing WTO Members no longer find a legal basis in section 15 for using so-called non-market economy (NME) methodologies for determining the normal value of Chinese imports. Hence, investigating authorities must now rely exclusively on the provisions of the Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA) when investigating imports from China. In December 2017, the European Union amended its basic Anti-Dumping Regulation in view of the expiry of section 15(a)(ii). Following the entry into force of the recently adopted amendments, the Regulation no longer explicitly discriminates between WTO Members by mandating NME treatment for certain countries, among which China. However, it still requires the European Commission to employ an NME-like methodology with regard to imports from any WTO Member, where it determined that it would not be ‘appropriate to use domestic prices and costs in the exporting country due to the existence in that country of significant distortions’. This article analyzes the compatibility of the new methodology with the provisions of the ADA in light of the reports of the Appellate Body and of the Panel in EU – Biodiesel. It is submitted that even though the recent amendments could possibly shield the Regulation from an ‘as such’ claim of WTO-inconsistency, the use of the new methodology is unlikely to be allowed by the ADA.", 22 January 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 4, December 2017, Pages 951–977, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgx036
