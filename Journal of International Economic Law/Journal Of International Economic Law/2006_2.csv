0,A Clash of Cultures? The UNESCO Diversity Convention and International Trade Law,['Michael Hahn'],"The adoption, on 20 October 2005, of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (Diversity Convention) has returned the limelight to the suitability of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for cultural products. This article shows that the Diversity Convention, while an important step towards the recognition of cultural diversity as an internationally recognized public choice of states, does not affect the rights and obligations of WTO Members as such. The original purpose of the Convention was to create a safe haven for cultural policies and protect them from WTO disciplines. However, the central operative provision for bringing about the desired shielding effect for domestic policies safeguarding national cultural industries against foreign competition, its now-article 20, while making a general claim to non-subordination in paragraph 1, modifies this broad statement in paragraph 2 so as to only apply to treaties concluded at the same time or later. The article explores how to avoid or minimize an undesirable incongruence between liberal trade rules and the right of states to protect shelf-space for domestically produced cultural products.", 20 August 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 3, September 2006, Pages 515–552, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl021
1,The New UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity: A Counterbalance to the WTO?,['Christoph Beat Graber'],"On 20 October 2005, the 33rd UNESCO General Conference adopted by a majority of 148 votes to two the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (CCD). The major objectives of the CCD are the recognition of the dual nature of cultural expressions as objects of trade and artefacts of cultural value and the recognition of the sovereign right of governments to formulate and implement cultural policies and measures for the protection and promotion of cultural diversity. The ambitious role assigned to the CCD by its proponents is to fill an existing lacuna for cultural objectives in public international law and to serve as a cultural counterbalance to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in future conflicts between trade and culture. Opponents, however, have criticized the CCD as an instrument of disguised protectionism and claimed that it violates freedom of expression and information. This article endeavours to explain how cultural diversity has become an issue of international law and provides a critical assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the CCD. It explores in particular the possible linkages between the CCD and the WTO.", 08 August 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 3, September 2006, Pages 553–574, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl018
2,The Protection of Geographical Indications After Doha: Quo Vadis?,"['G. E. Evans', ' Michael Blakeney']","During the last twenty years the international protection of geographical indications (GIs) has experienced a worldwide resurgence spurred by both the greater need and the additional opportunities offered by the global marketplace for the diversification of agricultural products and foodstuffs. The Doha Ministerial Declaration lends support to developing countries that are seeking forms of knowledge less than high technology that they have the capacity to exploit. June 2005 saw the European Communities submit a radical proposal, designed to also meet the needs of developing countries that would amend the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) Agreement in favour of a mandatory multilateral system of registration for all products. Yet, World Trade Organization (WTO) Members are as divided over their capacity to take advantage of GI protection no less than they are as to the means of regulation. To date, no ready solution to the further global harmonization of GIs has been found. This paper examines the two major regulatory models advanced by the European Union and the United States of America for the protection of GIs. In the light of the Doha Development Agenda, the authors argue in favour of an incremental approach that would allow developing countries the flexibility to adjust additional protection in accordance with their level of economic development.", 12 July 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 3, September 2006, Pages 575–614, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl016
3,Allocating the Burden of Proof in WTO Disputes: A Critical Analysis,['Michelle T. Grando'],"This article argues that the World Trade Organization (WTO) jurisprudence on the allocation of the burden of proof is in a confused state. Panels and the Appellate Body have failed to produce a consistent line of cases, which can be used as a predictable model to solve future cases. Furthermore, the jurisprudence has also created artificial differences between similar provisions, raising questions about the relevance of the criteria employed to distinguish provisions that must be proved by the defendant from those that must be proved by the complainant. The analysis undertaken in this article suggests that it may be time to reflect upon the basic question of why the burden of proof should be allocated to a given party. The article explores alternatives and suggests courses of action.", 17 August 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 3, September 2006, Pages 615–656, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl020
4,"Human Rights, Risks, and New Strategies for Global Investment",['Sheldon Leader'],"It is often argued that the rules and practices of foreign direct investment can threaten the protection of human rights. That danger used to arise from the fact that the investors simply dismissed concern for these rights as their responsibility. This is no longer so. Major lenders and project sponsors now regularly make commitments to human rights and to allied principles governing environmental protection and health and safety. The danger instead arises from the way in which the two domains are being brought together. The collision that threatens is not over whether, but over how commercial imperatives are to be integrated with this branch of social justice.
The article aims at diagnosis of the problem and considers some possible solutions to it. It frames the issues in terms of several competing fundamental principles, and draws on concrete examples from the investment contracts regulating the Baku – Tibilisi - Ceyhan (BTC) and Chad/Cameroon pipeline projects. Once the areas of potential collision between these contracts and human rights requirements are explored, the essay considers a significant alteration to the BTC agreement, designed to open it up more effectively to human rights concerns. The analysis ends with a consideration of some model clauses for investment contracts in the future.", 20 August 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 3, September 2006, Pages 657–705, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl015
5,"Human Rights, Development, and the WTO: The Cases of Intellectual Property and Competition Policy","['Robert D. Anderson', ' Hannu Wager']","The World Trade Organization (WTO) has sometimes been portrayed as being at odds with the protection of human rights. This article takes issue with this perception, both generally and with specific reference to WTO agreements/activities in the areas of intellectual property (IP) and competition policy. The rules and procedures of the WTO are directly supportive of civil rights in the sense of freedom to participate in markets and freedom from arbitrary governmental procedures. In addition, the system contributes to development and to the realization of broader economic, social, and cultural rights, by stimulating economic growth and thereby helping to generate the resources that are needed for the fulfilment of such rights. The article examines various human rights and public interest rationales for the protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs). The recent amendment to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to facilitate access to medicines in the event of public health emergencies is outlined. With respect to competition policy, such policy constitutes an important aspect of governance in successful market-based economies. There is a clear need for cooperative approaches to the implementation of national competition policies. The appropriate scope and venue for such cooperation are a matter for further deliberation.", 12 August 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 3, September 2006, Pages 707–747, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl022
