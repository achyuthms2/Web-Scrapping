0,Human rights and international economic law in the 21st century. The need to clarify their interrelationships,['E-U Petersmann'],"This article discusses the legal consequences of the 'human rights revolution' for public international law in general and WTO law in particular. The universal recognition of human rights calls for the constitutionalization of international law and foreign policies based on human rights and principles of rule of law, limitation and separation of government powers, social justice, 'democratic peace', and national as well as international constitutionalism. The eight core principles of constitutionalism must be applied in a mutually complementary manner at local, national, and international levels wherever power risks being abused. Constitutionalism is described as a bottom-up struggle for the protection of human rights and human dignity in the Kantian sense of maximum equal liberty for the personal development of every individual. The WTO guarantees of freedom, non-discrimination, rule of law, compulsory adjudication of international disputes, and of a mutually beneficial division of labor are shown to be compatible with the six basic functions of human rights law. The emerging 'right to democracy' and the increasing focus on 'positive integration law' in WTO negotiations call for democratic reforms of WTO law and of its 'constitutional infrastructure' for the benefit of the citizens. UN human rights law must overcome its long-standing neglect of economic liberties, property rights and of competition law as a necessary complement of human rights. The universalization of human rights and of WTO law offer mutually beneficial synergies that require increased cooperation between human rights activists, the WTO, and the world trade community for the benefit of the citizens and their human rights.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 3–39, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.3
1,More power to the WTO?,['MCEJ Bronckers'],"Because of its unique characteristics (package deals; effective dispute resolution), the WTO has the potential to become a key pillar of global governance. In principle, it could very well take on additional duties relating to the environment, labour, investment, competition law, etc. Yet in its present form, the WTO cannot responsibly assume a larger mandate. A number of fundamental, institutional changes will first have to be made. Trade and other societal values incorporated in the WTO framework ought to be recognized as equals; a liberal trade bias to interpret each and every rule in the WTO package is to be excluded. Co-operation with specialized international organizations, and NGOs, to prepare and implement new norms must intensify. To a greater extent the WTO ought to operate as an open, rather than a self-contained, regime under public international law. It is up to its members, the now some 140 countries including the European Union, to enable the WTO to take up this challenge. If national governments do so, and thereby take the need for global governance seriously, the WTO deserves a better name: the World Economic Organization, the WEO.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 41–65, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.41
2,The WTO 'constitution' and proposed reforms: seven 'mantras' revisited,['JH Jackson'],"This article invites the reader to take a step back and look at the big picture of the world trading system. After putting the WTO into its historic perspective, seven catch phrases that sound reassuring, but are almost never thought through, the so-called seven 'Mantras', are questioned. Observations from Seattle lead to reflections on internal decision-making, before the focus is broadened to external relations of the WTO, a discussion of transparency and the participation of non-state actors. In its conclusion, this article suggests that systemic or 'constitutional' issues deserve deeper discussion and analysis for a healthy evolution of the system as a whole.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 67–78, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.67
3,Has the WTO dispute settlement system exceeded its authority? A consideration of deference shown by the system to member government decisions and its use of issue-avoidance techniques,['WJ Davey'],"A systematic study of 38 adopted decisions of the Appellate Body and Panels since the inception of the WTO Dispute Settlement System leads to the conclusion that the WTO Dispute Settlement System remains generally within the boundaries of its authority. With a few limited exceptions, the system has shown sufficient deference to legitimate policy decisions made by WTO Member Governments. Further, US and international law rules on techniques used to dispose of cases (or issues within cases) where a decision seems unnecessary or inappropriate could be used more frequently with regard to the timing of consideration of issues (mootness and ripeness) as well as the exercise of judicial economy.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 79–110, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.79
4,"Power, rules and principles - which orientation for WTO/GATT law?",['M Hilf'],"Are principles just 'phony concepts' or the very heart of every legal system? The purpose of this article is to inquire to what extent one might describe the WTO system as having triple-jumped from a power-oriented system to a rule-based system and finally to a principle-oriented system. This comparison should not be taken literally. Of course, there have not been 'jumps'. In reality there has been a continuing process in which power, rules, and principles evolved gradually. What are these principles, which also were referred to in the Preamble of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization as basic principles underlying the multilateral trading system? This article searches Appellate Body reports in an effort to identify the use of principles. It first looks at eight 'internal' principles, e.g. trade liberalization, non-discrimination, sovereignty, and sustainable development, derived from WTO Agreements and focuses then on 'external' principles derived from public international law. Finally, the article discusses the proper role and ranking of principles in the WTO legal system and suggests that these should be balanced by using the principle of proportionality as applied by the International Court of Justice or extensively by the European Court of Justice.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 111–130, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.111
5,Implementation and enforcement of WTO dispute settlement findings: an EU perspective,['A Rosas'],"The EU has no reason to be disappointed with the dispute settlement system created by the Uruguay Round, with regards to both the system itself and the actual outcome of disputes settled. But all WTO Members have a common interest in improving the system, including the question of implementation and enforcement. The article discusses various alternatives for enhancing implementation and enforcement, including the possibility to strengthen the rights of private parties and to shorten and re-design the deadlines for implementation and compliance panel procedures. The article concludes that while in the present global trade system, the intergovernmental character of the WTO must be preserved, there is room for some shortening of deadlines, for making the panel system more permanent and professional, and for increasing the resources for the Appellate Body. Finally, the article mentions the possibility of creating a system of compulsory compensation, as an alternative to the present system of suspension of concessions.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 131–144, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.131
6,Some reflections on the WTO dispute settlement system from a practitioner's perspective,['JHJ Bourgeois'],"This brief article advocates the establishing of a standing or standing WTO Dispute Settlement panels. It also draws the attention to some deficiencies of a procedural nature, i.e. on standing, preliminary rulings, scope of disputes, judicial economy and appeals, and review of factual findings on appeal. It suggests improvements and raises the question whether interim relief should be provided.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 145–154, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.145
7,Practical suggestions for amicus curiae briefs before WTO adjudicating bodies,"['G Marceau', ' M Stilwell']","The evolution of the multilateral trading system, and the creation of the World Trade Organization, has heightened calls by non-governmental organizations to participate in decisions about trade policy, including in WTO dispute settlement as amicus curiae, or 'friends of the court'. Amicus briefs have now been received by a number of WTO panels and the Appellate Body, raising an outcry from many WTO Members, and calls by others for the creation of criteria to guide their use. This note explores the practical implications of amicus briefs, and suggests criteria for their use in light of current WTO practice, the goals of the WTO and its dispute settlement mechanism, and the practice of other international courts and tribunals. It commences by examining the main WTO disputes in which amicus briefs have been received, and the varying responses of WTO adjudicating bodies. It then examines the approach of other international fora - including the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea - to involvement of non-parties. Drawing on these experiences, it suggests that WTO panels and the Appellate body should weigh both substantive criteria (relating, for example, to the character of the amici, the nature of its submission, and the characteristics of the case) and procedural criteria (relating to issues such as timing and format) when determining whether, and if so, how to use amicus briefs. The note also identifies the mechanisms that may be used to establish criteria to ensure amicus briefs promote predictability and procedural fairness in WTO dispute settlement.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 155–187, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.155
8,"International economic law and the Internet: content, quality and research methods",['M Hoffman'],"There is a wealth of legal information available on the Internet and it continues to grow daily. While the Internet is the preferred starting point for many doing legal research, there are several issues that should be considered when using the Web for locating international legal documents and information. This Note provides an overview of some of the most fruitful Web sites for international economic law. Its focus is on the content and quality of these Web sites and also looks at some of the promising Internet projects currently underway that will aid the researcher in locating reliable information. Also included is an outline of some of the important issues to consider when accessing and using the Internet for international legal research.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 231–244, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.231
9,Legal and documentary research at WTO: the new documents on-line database,['JM Mesa'],"Documents On-Line(DOL) is a new Internet facility available free of charge to users all over the world since February 2001. Designed to be user-friendly, it allows users to search WTO documents in a number of different ways and presupposes no prior knowledge of WTO business. Two technologies have been used to facilitate documentation research: Catalogue searches and full-text searches. Simple catalogue searches can be performed using: title, countries symbol, date, etc. More advanced/complex searches can be performed, similar to those existing in the world of on-line legal research, including full-text searches. Full-text search also allows translators the possibility of identifying documents containing an expression sought in a given pair of languages: original and target. Future plans include user assistance: Member governments attending meetings will have access to the services of a help desk. On-line users will have an equivalent service via e-mail.", 01 March 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 1, March 2001, Pages 245–259, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.1.245
