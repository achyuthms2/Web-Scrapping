0,"The Crisis of 2007–09: Nature, Causes, and Reactions","['Rosa M. Lastra', ' Geoffrey Wood']","This article analyses the nature and causes of the financial crisis of 2007–09 as well as the regulatory responses. There are two types of crises: banking crises, which affect the money stock and thus threaten the economy, and financial crises, which may destroy wealth but do not endanger the economy as a whole. Banking crises can be precipitated by a shortage of capital or by a shortage of liquidity. The 2007–09 crisis was a banking crisis, caused by a capital shortage. Numerous explanations have been given for this crisis. In this article these explanations are organized into ten groups. The main factors were easy money, excessive leverage, risk-management failures, bad lending, too-big-to-fail (TBTF) policies, inadequate supervision, and ill-thought-out regulation. The flurry of responses to the crisis is then summarized. Some are welcome, but the article concludes that unless the fear of failure returns to banking, so that management, shareholders, bondholders, and all creditors (except small depositors) suffer in a failure, then all other reforms will ultimately be pointless.", 01 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 531–550, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq022
1,Systemic Regulation of Global Trade and Finance: A Tale of Two Systems,['R. Michael Gadbaw'],"The recent financial crisis has put enormous strains on the global systems governing international finance and trade. These two important international regulatory systems, created after World War II to promote growth and stability in the global economy, were put to the test in ways unprecedented since the 1930s. This article seeks to analyze and compare their performance as systemic regulators in the course of the crisis and concludes that the trading system performed quite well while the financial system virtually collapsed. This article seeks to account for this difference by looking at the nature of the rules and the institutions governing each and how they evolved so differently over the past 70 years. Central to the success of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a regulatory approach that includes rules designed, and tested in practice, to align incentives with the public good and prevent regulatory capture and a self-enforcing dispute settlement mechanism that ensures accountability and enforceability. The article concludes that these differences hold important lessons for the reform of the rules and institutions governing finance and trade in the global economy, and the role the WTO should play in this reform.", 01 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 551–574, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq031
2,The International Monetary System: A Look Back Over Seven Decades,['Andreas F. Lowenfeld'],"This article offers a historical account of the genesis and development of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The original design and functions are discussed and subsequent changes described, in particular the advent of floating currencies in 1971 in place of the original fixed exchange rate regime based on the US dollar. Ever since then, the IMF has not seen itself as being in a position to assume its main functions among industrialized countries. In particular, surveillance based upon Article IV procedures did not develop and mature. The article recalls some of the most important interventions of the Fund and reactions by countries affected. It concludes by addressing potential functions of the Fund to prevent future global financial crises.", 23 October 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 575–595, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq023
3,Towards a New Architecture for Financial Stability: Seven Principles,"['Luis Garicano', ' Rosa M. Lastra']","This article uses insights from organizational economics and financial regulation to study the optimal architecture of supervision. It suggests that the new architecture should revolve around the following principles: (i) banking, securities and insurance supervision should be further integrated; (ii) the macro-prudential supervisory function must be in the hands of the central bank; (iii) the relation between macro- and micro-supervisors must be articulated through a management by exception system involving direct authority of the macro-supervisor over enforcement and allocation of tasks; (iv) given the difficulty of measuring output on supervisory tasks, the systemic risk supervisor must necessarily be more accountable and less independent than central banks are on their monetary task; (v) the supervisory agency cannot rely on high-powered incentives to motivate supervisors, and must rely on culture instead; (vi) the supervisor must limit its reliance on self regulation; and (vii) the international system should substitute the current loose, networked structure with a more centralized and hierarchical one.", 01 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 597–621, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq041
4,Why Soft Law Dominates International Finance—and not Trade,['Chris Brummer'],"International financial law is in many ways a peculiar instrument of global economic affairs. Unlike international trade and monetary affairs, where global coordination is directed through formal international organizations, international financial law arises through inter-agency institutions with ambiguous legal status. Furthermore, the commitments made by regulatory officials participating in such forums are non-binding. This divergence is perplexing, especially when comparing international financial law to international trade. Both trade and finance comprise key areas of ‘international economic law’ and their rules have important distributive consequences for global markets and market participants. This article suggests that in order to understand soft law’s value as a coordinating mechanism, an institutional assessment of the way that law is enforced is necessary. Under close inspection, international financial law departs from traditional public international law notions of informality and can in fact be ‘harder’ than its soft-law quality suggests. This feature helps explain why international financial rules, though technically non-binding, are often relied upon. The predominance of international soft law in finance does not, however, imply that it is without flaws, and this article highlights important structural deficiencies that the World Trade Organization, a more mature legal regime, largely avoids.", 01 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 623–643, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq026
5,The ‘Santiago Principles’ for Sovereign Wealth Funds: A Case Study on International Financial Standard-Setting Processes,['Joseph J. Norton'],"This article considers the subject of ‘multi-level governance’ respecting ‘ “regulatory” financial standard-setting’ through the lens of the 2008 ‘Santiago Principles’ and 2009 establishment of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. Upon a US initiative, the matter fell on to the policy plate of the G-20 Finance Ministers and was then translated into ‘administrative marching orders’ for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Bank to work with the major sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) and others in devising a set of ‘best practices’. What transpired has been a sui generis, ad hoc, ‘multi-level, rule-oriented governance network process’. The immediate ‘deliverable’ has been a set of ‘international best practices’ (Santiago Principles). The related International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds encapsulates a new ongoing ‘institutional’, ‘administrative’, and ‘qualified self-regulatory’ process for implementing, interpreting, revising, adjusting, monitoring, and assessing these Principles and for further fostering their global acceptance as part of the post-global-financial-crisis ‘international architecture’. These developments add a new component to the global capital markets and to the proliferation of ‘global administrative networks’ and related ‘soft law regulation’ in the area of international economic financial law. Tangentially, this SWF phenomenon raises the question of the interconnected roles of the IMF, OECD, World Bank, United Nations, International Labour Organization and World Trade Organization, along with the related-linked ‘soft law, regulatory network(s)’, in the ‘new international financial architecture’.", 01 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 645–662, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq034
6,The Role and Prospects of International Law in Financial Regulation and Supervision,"['Christian Tietje', ' Matthias Lehmann']","The financial crisis of 2007–09 resulted in, inter alia, challenges for governments to modify financial regulation and supervision so as to ensure stability of financial markets without unduly hindering dynamic market developments. Moreover, the inherent transnational character of any financial market instrument nowadays has to be taken into account. This article discusses the proper allocation of powers in terms of harmonization and decentralization. It addresses conceptual challenges for contemporary financial regulation and supervision based on the idea of regulatory competition. While harmonization should be further pursued, regulatory competition based on a sound international framework of cooperation and coordination is central for successful financial regulation and supervision. There is no one-size-fits-all approach.", 01 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 663–682, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq030
7,Multilayered Governance in International Financial Regulation and Supervision,['Rolf H. Weber'],"In recent decades, financial markets have become increasingly international in scope, while the focus of financial regulation and supervision has largely remained limited to the domain of national jurisdictions. This article applies the doctrine of multilayered governance to financial markets, thereby addressing the discrepancy between international financial activities and nationally oriented financial regulation and supervision. It identifies core values that are widely shared within the international community, including the regulatory goals of financial stability and market integrity and the importance of confidence in the functioning of financial markets. The article argues that the scope of financial activities, the importance of regulatory objectives and the level of detail could serve as criteria for assessing how financial regulation should be allocated to the different levels of governance. In the proposed setting, standards could be a key to establishing multilayered governance as they allow for flexible adaptation of internationally agreed rules to national or regional particularities. Regarding financial supervision, the article highlights the importance of supervisory colleges or peer review procedures as a layer in between nationally based supervision and international supervisory standards.", 30 October 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 683–704, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq033
8,Border Problems,"['Charles A. E. Goodhart', ' Rosa M. Lastra']","There are several generic problems connected with financial regulation. Among them, two perennial problems are associated with the existence of important, but porous, borders, or boundaries. The first such boundary is that between regulated and non-regulated (or less regulated) entities. The second, key, border is that between states, where the legal and regulatory systems differ from state to state. In this article, we explore these two boundaries.", 01 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 705–718, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq042
9,"The International Law of Financial Crisis: Spillovers, Subsidiarity, Fragmentation and Cooperation",['Joel P. Trachtman'],"This article develops an analytical template for examining possible mechanisms for the avoidance and management of international financial crisis, focusing on certain areas of prudential financial regulation. This template examines questions of national regulatory policy reform, reasons for international cooperation and problems of cross-functional fragmentation. There is no evidence yet of beneficial regulatory competition in the case of this crisis. Shareholders and creditors do not seem systematically to have identified regulatory inadequacies, and migrated to stronger regulatory environments. So, competition-based discipline on lax regulation seems not to have worked. In order for each state to reduce risk through regulatory reform, states must work together to avoid cross-border harm that is not fully taken into account in national decision-making, and to avoid detrimental regulatory competition. They must work together to make rules, but they must recognize that our vision of the future is limited, and so they must establish institutions that will allow them to revise rules and institutions, as necessitated by unfolding change.", 01 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 719–742, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq038
10,Addressing Government Failure Through International Financial Law,['Steve Charnovitz'],"This study examines the causes of the financial crisis and proposes better policies at the international level. Based on a framework that sees government failure as a significant source of the problem, the study examines the new US Dodd–Frank legislation and critiques the Congressional approach to avoiding systemic risk. The study also presents a survey of the organizational efforts aimed at international financial reform and coordination, and critiques the lack of openness and public dialogue at the recent G-20 Summit in Toronto. Finally, the study proposes importing some techniques used in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) to monitor national policies.", 01 December 2010,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 13, Issue 3, September 2010, Pages 743–761, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq024
