0,Developing Disharmony? The SPS and TBT Agreements and the Impact of Harmonization on Developing Countries,['Graham Mayeda'],"The purpose of this article is to evaluate the benefits of legal harmonization within the framework of international trade law, with a particular focus on development and the effects on developing countries. It will begin with theoretical and normative claims for and against harmonization, and then turn to the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade in order to explore these claims within a specific context. Overall, we will see that harmonization is largely an ineffective tool for dealing with development issues. While it is important to develop institutional capacity in developing countries to deal with health, safety and technical standards, across-the-board harmonization fails to recognize the need for countries to adapt laws and legal institutions to domestic conditions. My exposition of the impact that the international trade regime can have on developing countries through a relatively circumscribed policy area, SPS and TBT measures, points to the need for anticipating similar impacts in other areas in which the international trade regime promotes legal harmonization.", 01 December 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 4, December 2004, Pages 737–764, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.4.737
1,Pre-Empting Protectionism in Services: The GATS and Outsourcing,"['Aaditya Mattoo', ' Sacha Wunsch-Vincent']","Cross-border trade in services is growing rapidly, with both developed and developing countries among the most dynamic exporters. Despite the substantial global benefits from such trade, the adjustment pressures created in importing countries could provoke a protectionist backlash – some signs of which are already visible in procurement and regulatory restrictions. The current negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda offer an opportunity to lock in current openness and pre-empt protectionism. This note describes how a bold initiative under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) can help secure openness.", 01 December 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 4, December 2004, Pages 765–800, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.4.765
2,The GATS and Regulatory Autonomy: A Case Study of Social Regulation of the Water Industry,['Andrew Lang'],"In June 2002, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report entitled ‘Liberalization of trade in services and human rights’. In this article, the author examines one of the concerns voiced in that report, that the GATS potentially affects the ability of governments to regulate the water industry in the pursuit of social objectives. This claim has been disputed by a number of other commentators. Taking both the claim and its critics on their own terms, he applies GATS non-discrimination articles to typical water sector regulation, to determine whether, and in what circumstances, such regulation potentially violates those provisions. He argues that one should view with some skepticism strong claims that the GATS does not restrict social regulation of the water sector, as they are often based on unjustifiably robust interpretations of the protective provisions of the GATS. At the same time, he identifies a number of promising argumentative strategies of potential use for those interested in protecting domestic regulatory autonomy in the water sector.", 01 December 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 4, December 2004, Pages 801–838, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.4.801
3,China's WTO Accession and the ASEAN–China Free Trade Area: The Perspective of a Chinese Lawyer,['Qingjiang Kong'],"China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) augurs well for the country's full integration with the world economy. It also greatly extends the horizon of China's regional economic co-operation and lends support to Asia's economic integration. China and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) are negotiating a free trade agreement (ACFTA) to be accomplished by 2010. As an initial step, they finalized the Framework Agreement for the ACFTA in Cambodia on 4 November 2002. For China, the ACFTA means new responsibilities. It has to make another major long-term commitment to a further opening of the door to ASEAN, on top of WTO requirements. The Chinese aspiration for an ACFTA mirrors its changing perception of globalization, with China's accession to the WTO serving as the catalyst. Nevertheless, some long-standing unsettled issues will continue to test its wisdom and magnanimity; the formulation of the ACFTA will not be a swift and smooth process, but rather a gradual one. Yet mutual interests between the two sides are likely to finally overcome the difficulties looming before the proposed ACFTA. The ACFTA will materialize and bring China and its Southeast Asian neighbors closer than ever before.", 01 December 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 4, December 2004, Pages 839–861, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.4.839
4,WTO Regulation of Subsidies to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) – A Critical Appraisal of the China Accession Protocol,['Julia Ya Qin'],"The existence of a large number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China and government subsidies to them has caused much concern among its trading partners. The Protocol on China's Accession to the WTO sets out certain provisions directly or indirectly addressing this concern. Among them are the provisions of an SOE-based specificity test and authorization for the importing country to use, on a permanent basis, alternative benchmarks in identifying and calculating Chinese subsidies. In addition, the Protocol excludes China from invoking the privatization exception available to developing country members under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. This article provides a critical analysis of the Protocol approach towards the issue of SOE subsidies and examines its implications for economic reform in China and for the WTO legal system.", 01 December 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 4, December 2004, Pages 863–919, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.4.863
