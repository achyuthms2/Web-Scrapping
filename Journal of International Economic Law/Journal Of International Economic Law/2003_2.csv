0,Retrospective Remedies in the WTO after Automotive Leather,"['Gavin Goh', ' Andreas R. Ziegler']","Prior to the Australia – Automotive Leather implementation report, it was widely understood by WTO Members that the WTO did not provide for retrospective remedies. The multilateral trading system was about a balance of rights and obligations with WTO remedies to preserve future trading opportunities rather than redress past injury. The Automotive Leather implementation panel's findings that ‘withdraw the subsidy’ under Article 4.7 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (the SCM Agreement) required retrospective repayment of past subsidies appeared to challenge this long‐standing understanding. This paper examines the Automotive Leather findings on remedy and argues that retrospective remedies have no basis either in past GATT practice nor under the WTO Agreements. The findings raised fundamental constitutional and democratic governance concerns given the legal constraints on the ability of Member governments to recall subsidies already provided lawfully and in good faith to private companies. They also highlight the need for caution in transposing currently accepted rules of the law of the European Community into the WTO legal order. Given the fundamental legal and policy concerns, the Automotive Leather findings on retrospective remedy have not been followed by panels and parties in subsequent WTO disputes. Canada's comments at the February 2000 meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body – that the findings will be treated by WTO Members ‘as a one‐time aberration of no precedential value’ – have therefore proved prophetic.", 01 September 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 3, September 2003, Pages 545–564, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.3.545
1,Informality and Effectiveness in the Operation of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,['Andrés Rigo Sureda'],"The use of informal means to define the roles of the major organs of the Bank, to formulate institutional policies, to avoid disputes and sanctions or to interpret the treaty establishing the Bank has sustained its effectiveness and dynamism. Trends in the use of informality are not always consistent. Policy making is becoming more formal as a consequence of public scrutiny, while interpretation through the formal authoritative process is rare. Effectiveness of informality is not the only consideration. The legitimacy of informal practices may be questionable and should be judged in the context of the governance of the institution, which was framed taking into account certain functions and purposes.", 01 September 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 3, September 2003, Pages 565–596, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.3.565
2,Korea in the GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System: Legal Battle for Economic Development,['Dukgeun Ahn'],"Korea's economic development saga, which amazed economists and policymakers, has been filled with numerous trade disputes with its major trading partners. Despite the prevalence of such bilateral trade disputes, Korea had shown unequivocal resistance to resorting to the multilateral dispute settlement forum under the GATT system. Since the inception of the WTO, however, Korea has dramatically changed its attitude toward trade dispute settlement. The Korean experience of trade dispute settlement, therefore, seems a salient example of how the newly augmented system under the WTO is perceived and how it has been effectively utilized by average WTO Member countries in order to address international trade problems.", 01 September 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 3, September 2003, Pages 597–633, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.3.597
3,Standards of Review in WTO Dispute Resolution,['Matthias Oesch'],"This article explores the issue of standard of review in WTO dispute resolution. Standards of review have over the last years gained unprecedented political and systemic significance in panel and Appellate Body proceedings. They express a deliberate allocation of vertical power between WTO adjudicating bodies and national authorities to decide upon factual and legal issues. Therefore, this article contributes to the debate on the balance of powers between the judiciary of the WTO and its members. At the outset, it defines the issue of standard of review (Section I) and examines the commonly invoked rationales for deference towards members' perceptions of their obligations under the WTO (Section II). Then, it expounds the Uruguay Round negotiations (Section III) and turns to the current state of law and practice (Section IV). The analysis of the case law to date reveals that panels and the Appellate Body have in general applied intrusive standards of review. Such a conclusion holds true in particular for the interpretation of WTO law, but it also stands to reason with regard to factual findings. It is submitted that the policy of intrusiveness is correct from a legal perspective but contrasts with the various rationales speaking in favour of a more deferential attitude.", 01 September 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 3, September 2003, Pages 635–659, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.3.635
4,FTAA Negotiations: Short Overview,"['José Antonio Rivas‐Campo', ' Rafael Tiago Juk Benke']","As the year 2005 approaches, negotiations of what would be the largest free trade area on the globe, the FTAA, are entering the phase that will determine the architecture of Western Hemisphere trade. The underlying question in this article is the degree of trade liberalization that the FTAA could reach. Thus, this article first presents an overview of the structure of the negotiations, its principles, institutions and main events. Then it discusses some of the issues in the balance, including agricultural negotiations, modifications to the subsidies, antidumping and competition policy regimes, intellectual property rights, the regional application of the MFN principle as well as the interplay between the FTAA and other regional trade agreements. After presenting the main arguments of the key negotiating players, this article develops different scenarios, varying according to the degree of trade liberalization, which could be reached in each of the issues discussed", 01 September 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 3, September 2003, Pages 661–694, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.3.661
5,EC Liability for the Non‐Implementation of WTO Dispute Settlement Decisions – Advocate General Alber Proposes a ‘Copernican Innovation’ in the Case Law of the ECJ,['Geert A. Zonnekeyn'],"In two identical Opinions delivered on 15 May 2003 in the Biret cases, Advocate General Alber of the European Court of Justice (‘ECJ’), proposes that the European Community (‘EC’) may be held liable under EC law for the non‐implementation of WTO dispute settlement decisions within the prescribed reasonable period of time and the damages resulting therefrom for economic operators. The Advocate General opines that, in such circumstances, WTO law has direct effect and can thus be invoked by private parties in proceedings before the European courts in Luxembourg in order to trigger the liability of the EC. It remains to be seen whether the ECJ will be prepared to follow the ‘Copernican innovation’ proposed by the Advocate General. This note does not purport to give an exhaustive analysis of the Opinions of the Advocate General. It will focus on some of the more controversial issues dealt with in both Opinions.", 01 September 2003,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 6, Issue 3, September 2003, Pages 761–769, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/6.3.761
