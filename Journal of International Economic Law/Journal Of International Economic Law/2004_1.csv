0,A BRIDGE TOO FAR: THE FALL OF THE FIFTH WTO MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE IN CANCÚN AND THE FUTURE OF TRADE CONSTITUTION,['Sungjoon Cho'],"This article is intended to contribute to the process of diagnosis and prescription in response to the fiasco of the Fifth WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancún, Mexico, in September 2003. The article sketches previous WTO Ministerial Conferences in an attempt to glimpse the roots of the problems that eventually caused the collapse of the Cancún Conference. It then focuses on the main developments in Cancún and offers a ‘postmortem’, not in an attempt to place blame but to better understand what went wrong. It observes that North-South tension is likely to continue for the time being while rich countries, especially the US, will lean toward bilateralism and regionalism. Yet, it also suggests that with a combination of hard work by Member countries, political support from NGOs and businesses, and the Secretariat’s constructive role, the Doha Round can and should be saved. The article concludes that the global trading community is now embracing another ‘constitutional moment’ which parallels the creation of the GATT 1947 and the WTO.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 219–244, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.219
1,INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE ALIEN TORT STATUTE,"['Gary Clyde Hufbauer', ' Nicholas K. Mitrokostas']","The Alien Tort Statute of 1789 (ATS) remained virtually dormant until it was revived by the 1980 decision of the Second Circuit in Filartiga v Pena-Irala. Since Filartiga, plaintiffs, who are neither US citizens nor residents, have invoked the ATS for a widening range of claims alleging large damages from acts committed outside the United States. ATS suits are increasingly targeting the deep pockets of multinational corporations. In an upcoming case, Sosa v Alvarez-Machain, the US Supreme Court will have to address whether the ATS grants federal courts a flexible power to create new torts corresponding to evolving norms in the ‘law of nations’. The authors contend that a broad interpretation of the ATS will make US federal courts agents of judicial imperialism, doing great damage to foreign relations, as well as international trade and investment.
The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 245–262, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.245
2,SEPARATING MYTH FROM REALITY ABOUT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY LITIGATION,['Harold Hongju Koh'],"In recent months, commentators, corporations and the Bush Administration have joined forces to attack human rights and environmental litigation against corporate defendants under the Alien Tort Statute. This article argues that this attack rests on four myths: that United States courts cannot hold private corporations civilly liable for torts in violation of international law; that there is a flood of such cases that would impose liability on corporations simply for doing business in a difficult country; that statutory amendment or doctrinal reversal is necessary to stem this flood of litigation; and that domestic litigation is in any event a bad way to promote higher corporate standards. This article debunks each of the myths, explaining why in fact the sky is not falling, and why radical solutions are not needed to solve non-problems.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 263–274, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.263
3,THE GLOBALIZATION OF PRIVATE KNOWLEDGE GOODS AND THE PRIVATIZATION OF GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS,"['Keith E. Maskus', ' Jerome H. Reichman']","Global trade and investment have become increasingly liberalized in recent decades. This liberalization has lately been accompanied by substantive new requirements for strong minimum standards of intellectual property (IP) protection, which moves the world economy toward harmonized private rights in knowledge goods. While this trend may have beneficial impacts in terms of innovation and technology diffusion, such impacts would not be evenly distributed across countries. Deep questions also arise about whether such globalization of rights to information will raise roadblocks to the national and international provision of such public goods as environmental protection, public health, education, and scientific advance. This article argues that the globalized IP regime will strongly affect prospects for technology transfer and competition in developing countries. In turn, these nations must determine how to implement such standards in a pro-competitive manner and foster innovation and competition in their own markets. Developing countries may need to take the lead in policy experimentation and IP innovation in order to offset overly protectionist tendencies in the rich countries and to maintain the supply of global public goods in an emerging transnational system of innovation.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 279–320, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.279
4,THE REGULATION OF PUBLIC GOODS,['Peter Drahos'],"The paper examines the complex ways in which public goods are regulated. The provision and distribution of public goods is deeply affected by the degree of excludability of those goods and the regulatory context of that excludability. Using a decentered conception of regulation, the paper shows through various examples how state and non-state actors regulate each other's capacities to provide, access, and distribute public goods. The paper includes a discussion of the regulation of knowledge by the rules of intellectual property.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 321–339, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.321
5,ISSUES POSED BY A WORLD PATENT SYSTEM,['John H. Barton'],"There is a strong drive toward a world patent system, but such a system may pose special problems for the developing world. After reviewing the existing steps toward a global system, this paper describes the standards appropriate to a reasonable global patent, taking the perspective of the developing nations. It then describes a reasonable international enforcement procedure and the defenses appropriate in that process. It finally explores the institutional, financial, and political issues involved in creating such a global system. Movement to an international patent would save money, both by reducing filing fees and by reducing the legal costs of preparing parallel filings. It is possible to globalize the system in a way that raises the standards needed to obtain a patent. This would be better for the developing world, and industry (as opposed to the intellectual property bar) may actually be pleased with such a development. The alternate pattern, exemplified in the WIPO harmonization negotiations, is to create a system like that of the United States with relatively weak patentability standards and broad subject-matter standards and to harmonize those standards with those of generally likeminded nations and regions. The likely political next step is for the major developed countries to encourage developing-nations to sign up to that system. This alternative would be a mistake for the developing nations, and possibly for the developed nations as well.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 341–357, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.341
6,DO STRONGER PATENTS INDUCE MORE LOCAL INNOVATION?,['Lee G. Branstetter'],One of the central arguments advanced by proponents of stronger intellectual property rights (IPRs) systems is that strengthening such systems induces higher levels of innovation by domestic firms. This article reviews several empirical studies undertaken by economists to assess the validity of this claim. Most studies fail to find evidence of a strong positive response by domestic innovators that could be reasonably ascribed to the effects of stronger IPRs. The benefits of stronger IPRs – to the extent that they exist at all – are more likely to come instead from an acceleration in the domestic deployment of advanced technology by the affiliates of foreign firms., 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 359–370, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.359
7,LEGAL PERSPECTIVES ON TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE: THE CASE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,"['Thomas Cottier', ' Marion Panizzon']","This paper explores the feasibility of devising a new form of intellectual property (IP) protection that would recognize the social value of traditional knowledge (TK) and promote its integration into domestic and international trade regimes while respecting and preserving local autonomy and cultural values. Interest in the protection of TK is rooted in the goal of promoting social, economic, and ecological development of rural areas. It responds to concerns about fairness and equity in international economic relations affecting the livelihood of the bulk of the world’s population. The topic is also of importance in the context of redefining the relationship between public goods, private rights, and the transfer of technology. Taken together, these concerns lead us to evaluate the policies and legal instruments that are best suited to achieving equity, validation, and sustainability while preserving open access to plant genetic materials for scientific research.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 371–399, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.371
8,EXPANSIONIST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AND REDUCTIONIST COMPETITION RULES: A TRIPS PERSPECTIVE,['Hanns Ullrich'],"The article is divided into two parts. In the first, an examination of the competition rules in the TRIPS Agreement confirms the authority of Contracting States to develop their own antitrust policy regarding IP-related restrictive practices, provided this is done consistently with the TRIPS principles of IP protection. In the second part, the preceding analysis is confronted with the new reality of IP policies, the changed function and modes of exploitation of protection in the innovation-driven, globalized high tech economy. I argue that the backward-looking focus of TRIPS competition rules on technology dissemination does not match the actual trend of cooperation-based innovation, since, there, a level playing field may only be established by early participation in the innovation process and by early access to enabling information. As industrialized countries have revised their competition policy with a view to supporting group innovation and additionally enhancing the incentives resulting from IP protection, referral to TRIPS competition rules as a model for domestic antitrust law might contribute to deepening rather then overcoming the technology dependence of developing countries.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 401–430, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.401
9,INTERNATIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW AND THE PUBLIC DOMAIN OF SCIENCE,"['Graeme B. Dinwoodie', ' Rochelle Cooper Dreyfuss']","The TRIPS Agreement can be read to reflect a static view of the structure of intellectual property law. In this paper, we address whether – and how – the TRIPS Agreement can, on the other hand, be read with more fluidity, and thus to allow adjustments in national intellectual property regimes designed to reflect the dynamic nature of information production. To focus that inquiry, we concentrate on efforts to ensure a broader public domain for ‘upstream’ inventions by modifying various elements of US patent law. The paper considers three stylized examples and asks whether each approach could be adopted by the United States without falling afoul of the TRIPS Agreement as it is currently understood. Our purpose is to identify interpretive approaches that allow member states to keep their laws attuned to the developments and needs of science. But in so doing, we also raise broader questions regarding the level of formalism generated by the WTO dispute settlement system, and the extent to which the TRIPS Agreement allocates power between supranational and national institutions, and between international and national laws.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 431–448, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.431
10,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT IN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION,['Wilfred J. Ethier'],"With the advent of the TRIPS Agreement, international disputes about governmental regulation of intellectual property rights (IPRs) are now subject to adjudication within the WTO dispute resolution mechanism. The standard model used by economists to explain dispute settlement procedures is misleading, for the process is not about preventing countries from exercising market power. Rather, the system is designed to resolve political market failures arising within countries that would be harmful to market access for foreign firms. These issues arise particularly in the context of IPRs, which may be used as cross-market bargaining chips. This possibility is illustrated by the petition of Ecuador to suspend concessions in this area for European firms in the context of the EU – Banana case. The scope of such an approach remains unclear and there are many fundamental questions deserving close analysis. In this paper I make several basic points relating to the economics of IPRs and the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) dispute settlement process. These comments underscore the fact that the injection of IPRs into the global trading system raises a new dimension for settling disputes.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 449–457, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.449
11,RECOGNIZING PUBLIC GOODS IN WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT: WHO PARTICIPATES? WHO DECIDES? THE CASE OF TRIPS AND PHARMACEUTICAL PATENT PROTECTION,['Gregory Shaffer'],"The question of how to produce ‘global public goods’ in a world of sovereign states with divergent norms and preferences, reflecting differences in economic development levels, is increasingly on the international policy agenda. This question raises issues not only for political decision-making but also for judicial interpretation of existing international agreements. This article analyzes this fundamental question in the context of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), with particular emphasis on patent protection for pharmaceutical products. The TRIPS Agreement’s provisions raise concerns over at least three public (or quasi-public) goods in this area: the generation of new knowledge, the provision of public health, and the maintenance of rules fostering open trade and competition. WTO judicial panels charged with resolving disputes regarding patents on medicines must determine whether to defer to national sovereignty, multilateral negotiations, or their own interpretations in balancing among these objectives. Thus, questions of ‘who participates’ and ‘who decides’ will be critical in this determination. The article notes structural weaknesses in the ability of developing countries to participate meaningfully in the WTO judicial process and offers suggestions for making their participation more meaningful so as to protect their interests.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 459–482, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.459
12,EC LIABILITY FOR NON-IMPLEMENTATION OF WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT DECISIONS – ARE THE DICE CAST?,['Geert A. Zonnekeyn'],"The judgments of the ECJ in Biret seem to open the door for further discussions on the liability of the EC for non-implementation of WTO dispute settlement decisions. The ECJ refused to grant compensation to the applicants due the fact that the damages occurred before the adoption of the DSB decision and before the reasonable period of time accorded to the EC to implement this decision had lapsed. Since the ECJ did not explicitly pronounce itself on the question whether compensation could have been awarded if the damages had arisen after the reasonable period of time, it seems to have left the door half open. It is important that the ECJ does so without insisting – as it has done in its previous judgments concerning the effect of WTO law in the EC legal order – on reciprocity, that is without requiring whether any other of the EC’s major trading partners would allow such damage claims. In addition, a recent judgment of the ECJ seems to indicate that the Nakajima line of case law, according to which the ECJ or the CFI may review the legality of an EC act in cases where the EC intends to implement a particular obligation entered into within the framework of the WTO, will play an essential role in the cases which are currently pending before the ECJ and CFI.", 01 June 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 483–490, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.2.483
