0,Export Policies and the General Agreement on Trade in Services,['Rudolf Adlung'],"Compared to its counterpart in merchandise trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1947, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) contains a variety of conceptual innovations. In addition to cross-border supplies, the Agreement covers three additional types of transactions, i.e. supplies in a foreign country to consumers that have moved abroad as well as supplies provided by foreign-owned firms and foreign service professionals in a host market. At the same time, the GATS accommodates a range of measures, including the use of quantitative restrictions and discriminatory taxes and subsidies, which is clearly constrained under the GATT. Most notably in the current context, the Agreement offers particularly broad scope for various types of export-related interventions, regardless of ensuing market distortions. The social and economic relevance of such measures, not only in sectors such as education or health, but also in producer-oriented services, including transport, telecommunications or finance, is immediately evident. This article seeks to provide an overview and assessment in the light of relevant GATS provisions and WTO dispute rulings.", 28 August 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 487–510, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv031
1,The ‘Greenization’ of Chinese Bits: An Empirical Study of the Environmental Provisions in Chinese Bits and its Implications for China’s Future Bit-Making,['Manjiao Chi'],"Incorporating environmental provisions (EPs) in International investment agreements is an important way for states to confront grave environmental challenges through the discourse of international investment law. An empirical study of the EPs incorporated in all 104 Chinese BITs in force shows that only a limited number of Chinese BITs contain EPs and that the generational and regional distribution of the EPs are imbalanced. The overall lack and low quality of the EPs make Chinese BITs as a whole insufficiently environmentally friendly. This study reveals that Chinese BITs are getting increasingly ‘green’, especially the recent decade. Mere incorporation of EPs in BITs does not necessarily make BITs ‘green’. Whether and to what extent EPs can play a constructive role in environmental protection depends on how they are applied and how the two seemingly conflicting purposes of BITs, i.e. investment protection and environmental protection, are reconciled in international investment arbitration. China has an urgent need to ‘greenize’ its BITs. Toward this end, China should, first, enhance the availability and effectiveness of EPs in its BITs; second, make consorted efforts to incorporate certain EP-related provisions in its BITs and relevant national laws; third, change its current dichotomic BIT-making strategy.", 03 September 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 511–542, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv029
2,The GATT Article III:8(a) Procurement Derogation and Canada – Renewable Energy,['Arwel Davies'],"This article compares and reviews the panel and Appellate interpretations of the GATT Article III:8(a) procurement derogation in Canada – Renewable Energy. When this derogation is available, discriminatory domestic content requirements fall outside of the general GATT Article III:4 national treatment obligation, and are capable of challenge only under the more limited coverage of the plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). It is argued that the panel’s understanding should be preferred over that of the Appellate to preserve the operation of the derogation in paradigm situations and to avoid the multilateralization of obligations acceded to, or possibly not yet acceded to, under the GPA.", 02 September 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 543–554, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv027
3,The Legality of the European Union’s Special Incentive Arrangement,['Vichithri Jayasinghe'],"Globalization has propelled a mass influx of trading, opportunities, wealth, and cross-border relations. But, it has also added distance to the seemingly endless gap between developed and developing nations. Amidst this economic disparity, trade preferences present a solution to alleviate developing country dissatisfaction by providing access to international markets. It finds legitimacy in the Enabling Clause, which departs from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade’s principles of non-discrimination and reciprocity, and ensures that special and differential treatment is accorded to respond positively to the ‘development, financial and trade needs’ of developing countries. The focus of this article will be the European Union’s (EU) GSP+ Scheme that assists the entry of vulnerable economies to the EU’s international market. Contravening the rule against reciprocity, EU Regulation 978/2012 mandates the fulfilment of specific conditions before the granting of concessions. These conditions have the effect of increasing the burdens and responsibilities of vulnerable economies. Despite the Regulation’s apparent magnanimity, it is unilateral and fails to inquire into the real ‘development, financial and trade needs’ in developing economies. As a result, due to a lack of bargaining power, they find themselves compelled to fulfil EU obligations, which may have little or no bearing to the real causes for concern. This article endeavours to examine the legality of the GSP+ conditions in light of the Enabling Clause.", 19 August 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 555–575, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv032
4,Transformative Transatlantic Free Trade Agreements without Rights and Remedies of Citizens?,['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"Evaluations of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) among Canada and the European Union (EU) and of the ongoing EU–US negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) depend on their legal, economic, and political methodologies for multilevel governance of public goods (PGs) like a transatlantic market. In contrast to the American and European post-war leadership for democratic governance of PGs (as recalled in Section I), the CETA fails to adequately protect democratic governance, rights of citizens, and judicial remedies in transatlantic market regulation (Section II). TTIP negotiators likewise prioritize economic and utilitarian group interests in order to limit opposition to a successful completion of TTIP; this risks undermining ‘republican governance’ and rights of citizens as limitations on the longstanding governance failures in the Transatlantic Partnership since the 1990s (Section III). Rather than complying with the EU Treaty requirements to base external free trade agreements (FTAs) on the ‘constitutional values’ that successfully govern market regulation and competition throughout Europe, trade negotiators abuse their ‘executive monopoly’ over transatlantic negotiations so as to limit their own legal, democratic, and judicial accountability vis-à-vis citizens. Civil society and parliaments should resist such ‘disconnected Westphalian governance’ and insist that international treaties with ‘legislative functions’ for protecting transnational PGs must be governed democratically and protect transnational rights and remedies of citizens so as to enable the ‘democratic principals’ to hold governance agents and their limited ‘constituted powers’ more accountable for the ubiquity of ‘market failures’ and ‘governance failures’ that continue to distort transatlantic relations, rule of law, and consumer welfare.", 12 August 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 579–607, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv030
5,Fostering Transatlantic Regulatory Cooperation and Gradual Multilateralization,['Bernard Hoekman'],"The ongoing negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and the USA revolve to a significant extent around an effort to reduce the trade cost-raising effect of differences in regulation. The extent to which a TTIP will generate economic benefits will be determined in large part by the extent to which it will reduce such costs. This will also be a major factor determining the impacts of a TTIP on third countries. This article reflects on some of the challenges confronting regulatory cooperation, proposes several mechanisms to support greater cooperation on regulatory matters, and discusses how TTIP-based regulatory initiatives might be multilateralized over time.", 02 September 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 609–624, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv028
6,The Regulatory Cooperation Chapter of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership: Institutional Structures and Democratic Consequences,['Alberto Alemanno'],"The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) has the potential to remake political and legal relationships between the European Union (EU) and the USA and pave the way to a new form of global economic governance based on international regulatory cooperation. In particular, TTIP presents an historic opportunity for the EU and the USA to remove regulatory divergence—today’s most prominent obstacle to trade exchanges—thereby increasing economic growth for the citizens of both polities. Yet, the EU and the USA have been attempting to reduce trade barriers since the 1970s. Despite decades of cooperation, EU and US policymakers too often fail to mutually understand each other’s positions, giving rise to regulatory differences. As an international agreement predicted to contain a Horizontal Chapter—an innovative approach to international trade treaty-making containing a framework for future bilateral regulatory cooperation—TTIP has the potential to transform this impasse, if approached correctly. The envisaged chapter would provide a ‘gateway’ for handling sectoral regulatory issues between the EU and the USA, including by addressing both legislation and non-legislative acts, regardless of the level at which they are adopted and by whom. Yet with great promises come challenges too.
This article focusses on the structure, scope, discipline, institutional design, enforcement, and implementation of the envisaged horizontal chapter, often defined Regulatory Cooperation Chapter. In so doing, it addresses some of the concerns currently raised by civil society, in particular the fear of a ‘race to the bottom’ that may stem from the operation of this chapter and provides some recommendations.", 28 August 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 625–640, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv026
7,When Does the Exception Become the Rule? Conserving Regulatory Space under CETA,['Armand de Mestral'],"The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is certainly the most complex free trade agreement (FTA) ever negotiated by Canada and arguably the most far-reaching ever negotiated by the European Union (EU). Like North American Free Trade Agreement 1994 before it, CETA may well become a model for future mega-regional FTAs. This article explores the seeming paradox that CETA innovates both by its extensive scope and by its very extensive use of exceptions provisions. These exceptions both general and specific are examined. It is argued that these exceptions are needed because, while both parties seek much closer regulatory cooperation, they are also under pressure for legal and political reasons to be seen to preserve regulatory space.", 11 September 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 641–654, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv033
8,Is Investor–State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) Superior to Litigation Before Domestic Courts? An EU View on Bilateral Trade Agreements,['Marco Bronckers'],"The mechanism of Investor–State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) allows private foreign investors to challenge government measures before an ad hoc international arbitral tribunal. ISDS has been in existence for a long time. Yet recently this mechanism has proven very controversial, notably in the European Union and then the United States, when it became part of the negotiations on a comprehensive free trade agreement (TTIP) between them. According to critics, ISDS unduly limits the policy space of the signatory governments, and suffers from inadequate procedures. Some have argued that foreign investor claims should be dealt with like other private claims, by domestic courts. Others have argued that domestic courts should not become involved at all, and that foreign investor claims should be dealt with exclusively by state-to-state dispute settlement. This debate about ISDS is actually connected to broader discussions in the EU about whether private parties (not just foreign investors) should be permitted to invoke international law before domestic courts. Efforts by the EU institutions to limit the impact of bilateral trade agreements have been under way, though mostly surreptitiously, for several years. This article seeks to analyze the merits and implications of this policy shift, while tracing the development of the European debate on ISDS.", 11 September 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 655–677, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv035
9,How will TPP and TTIP Change the WTO System?,"['Gary Clyde Hufbauer', ' Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs']","The rise of new free trade agreements in the 1990s and early 2000s altered the dynamic of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the arbiter of world commerce forever. Moreover, WTO negotiating rounds over the past decade have been beset with irreconcilable objectives among WTO members, with emerging market members fundamentally opposed to opening their markets to exports from advanced countries. The consequence was scant progress and missed deadlines, culminating in the failed Geneva Ministerial of 2008. At the Bali Ministerial in 2013, the WTO members could only muster strength to endorse the Trade Facilitation Agreement, while postponing action on numerous and more contentious Doha issues. The cumulative result is that the WTO is now at the back of the parade in addressing 21st-century trade issues. Two mega-regionals—the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)—will undoubtedly change the multilateral trading system. This article assumes both negotiations will be concluded and ratified by 2018. However, even if neither mega-regional agreement succeeded, their negotiating objectives and ultimate stumbling blocks will shape the future of the WTO. If WTO members collectively reject the lessons, the institution will fade as an arbiter of commercial relations between nations.", 12 August 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 3, September 2015, Pages 679–696, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv036
