0,"Capturing Commitment in Informal, Soft Law Instruments: A Case Study on the Basel Committee","['Enrico Milano', ' Niccolò Zugliani']","The present article investigates the legal nature of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and seeks to identify the legal effects of the acts produced by the committee under public international law. It reassesses the most influential contemporary theories that have endeavoured to describe and capture the increasing trend towards ‘de-formalization’ of international law, of which the Basel Committee, with its peculiar composition and standard-setting activities, is generally considered as one of the most significant examples. The articles comes to the conclusion that the Basel Committee’s normative outputs cannot be qualified as legal acts or legal facts under international law as they are best described as the results of flexible and informal standard-setting activities developed by domestic regulators at the international level, with a view to inducing compliance by national legislators and stakeholders. The lack of a formal ‘pedigree’ under international law has not undermined their effectiveness; on the contrary, it can be considered a peculiar feature of a successful model of transnational cooperation where soft law standards have been translated into domestic legislation.", 12 July 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 2, June 2019, Pages 163–176, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz009
1,The Governance of Global Banking in the Face of Complexity,['Matteo Ortino'],"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the composite wider legal and institutional environment to which it is part provide a useful case study to illustrate how complexity is addressed in the public policy realm. As its central proposition, this article argues that it is possible to identify a specific pattern and logic underlying the governance of global banking today. The pattern concerns the institutional dimension of global banking regulation, particularly with respect to the distribution of regulatory powers among the various actors involved, and the legal relationships between these actors. The overall pattern seems to follow a certain logic, which will be explored and explained borrowing the military distinction between strategy, operations, and tactics.", 08 July 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 2, June 2019, Pages 177–204, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz010
2,The European Union in the Transnational Financial Regulatory Arena: The Case of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,['Annamaria Viterbo'],"Starting from the observation of an increased politicisation of the financial regulatory debate, the article analyses how this might impact the relationship between the European Union (EU) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The article first describes transnational financial networks after the global crisis and the shift from trust in technocratic autonomy to distrust and politicisation. It then turns to examine the legal bases for the participation of EU institutions in the Basel standard-setting process, discussing the challenges posed under EU law. The last part of the research focusses on the European Parliament’s attempts to become an active player in the transnational financial regulatory arena and on the role it might play to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the Basel process.", 03 June 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 2, June 2019, Pages 205–228, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz013
3,Public Administrative Law in a Globalized Concept: Legal Nature of the Collaboration of the EU and the Basel Committee,['Erzsébet Csatlós'],"Multilevel governance describes a global system that enrolls some State functions to perform global solutions for global problems. Multilevel-governance and multilevel administration has legality and accountability concerns on their own, although, there are multilevel structures with non-State playground of trans-regulatory nature at the supranational level of cooperation which means additional shades to the colourful palette. The procedure and the structure concerning the creation and the evaluation of effective banking supervision standards in Europe is unique. Given the fact that the European administrative system is also unique, and as Basel rules are produced in a trans-regulatory network, the collaboration of the two sui generis systems requires the rethinking of the classical legal order features. Rule of law which is the basis of classical international relations in the view of public administration of States is challenged by the newly emerged solutions. Necessity and proportionality are put on a scale with classical values and requirements of public administration and efficiency and effectiveness seem to put it on the side of the new type of collaboration. The normative background of such structure is still immature. The multilevel administrative system of financial supervision including the European Union and the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision at supranational level or speaking in a wider context: the framework for multilevel governance with non-state actors at supranational level, is therefore an example for global administrative law of infant status.", 10 June 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 2, June 2019, Pages 229–245, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz015
4,Governance of the Global Financial System: The Legitimacy of the BCBS 10 years after the 2008 Crisis,['Jose Gustavo Prieto Muñoz'],"This article explores the question of legitimacy that underpins Basel III. First, I present a general framework for assessing how legitimacy operates within the global financial system through an analysis of the internal and external dimensions. I next address the internal dimension, exploring the legitimacy of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) as a body that exercises a type of public authority through the generation of norms/standards. I then analyse how the public law standards of transparency and accountability are currently being implemented within the BCBS system. Finally, I examine the external dimension, considering how the legitimacy of the BCBS is related to the international system. In particular, it is argued that because of the direct link between bailouts and human rights violations, the legitimacy of the BCBS is also tied to its role in promoting financial stability in the post-crisis architecture by protecting social rights within states.", 28 June 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 2, June 2019, Pages 247–260, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz011
5,Basel and the IASB: Accountability Interdependencies and Consequences for Prudential Regulation,['Jan Riepe'],"Accountability is a key concern for international standard setters. If transnational actors set standards instead of national democratic authorities, then the standard setters might suffer from ‘apparent’ deficits in their democratic accountability and oversight. Consequently, most international standard setters rely on different processes to enhance their accountability and transparency to mitigate concerns about their own standards. Ensuring accountability is already a major challenge for a single or homogenous set of rules or standards. So how can a supranational body design legitimate rules that rest on the standards of another very different supranational standard setter? This study examines the accountability and transparency concerns from the interaction of supranational standard setters that have different objectives. Therefore, I investigate the processes of prudential regulation based on the capital adequacy standard of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that relies on the financial accounting standards set by the International Accounting Standards Board. The results show flaws with respect to accountability in the regulatory process that involves another standard setter and how the prudential regulator reacts to these flaws to ensure a higher degree of accountability in its banking regulation.", 28 June 2019,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 22, Issue 2, June 2019, Pages 261–283, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgz012
