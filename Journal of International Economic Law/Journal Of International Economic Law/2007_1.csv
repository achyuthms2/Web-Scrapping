0,Negotiations on Safeguards and Subsidies in Services: a Never-ending Story?,['Rudolf Adlung'],"After the Uruguay Round, negotiations under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) continued in several rule-making areas, including emergency safeguards and subsidies. However, there has been little progress to date. The negotiations on safeguards appear to have suffered from a combination of high ambition, limited flexibility and, possibly, too much inspiration from the existing mechanism under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yet the GATS is different in at least two respects: its reach has been extended from cross-border trade to factor flows, and from an essentially tariff-only regime to many more permissible restrictions, including import-displacing subsidies. The question arises, whether and where safeguards could still serve a useful purpose. At the same time, with less enthusiasm, however, WTO Members have discussed the need for additional subsidy disciplines beyond current Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) and, in scheduled sectors, national treatment obligations. A link between the two areas has not been established. This article thus seeks to identify and, as far as possible, tie up loose ends. While there appears to be little scope for GATT-type safeguards in services, a transitory arrangement, which allows for suspensions of new commitments during an implementation phase, might encourage more ambitious liberalization under the GATS.", 26 March 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2007, Pages 235–265, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm004
1,Smooth as Silk? A First Look at the Post MFA Textiles and Clothing Landscape,['Denis Audet'],"Despite the imposition of temporary safeguard measures on Chinese exports by both the United States and the European Union in 2005, few countries other than China and India have increased their clothing exports in markets where Multi-Fiber Arrangement quotas had been removed, e.g. the European Union, the Unites States, and Canada. This article argues that the elimination of import quotas has exposed the vulnerability of fragmented supply chains and favoured countries able to display an integrated supply chain, i.e. domestic production of high quality textile and clothing products. In terms of trade policy implications, the elimination of quotas has reduced the attractiveness of outward processing programmes and, conversely, increased the attractiveness of other preferential trade arrangements, such as regional trade arrangements and the Generalized System of Preferences. The July 2006 postponement of the Doha Round negotiations represents a setback for WTO Members and, with respect to the textile and clothing issues, widespread anxiety among supplying countries due to the competitive strength of China acts against a package of significant tariff reduction applied on a most-favoured-nation basis. To move the Doha negotiations forward, political will is required in agricultural negotiations, including a development-friendly resolution of the problem of cotton subsidies.", 10 May 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2007, Pages 267–284, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm003
2,"The WTO, Science, and the Environment: Moving Towards Consistency","['Andrew Green', ' Tracey Epps']","Governments are increasingly using taxes to address a variety of environmental concerns. World Trade Organization (WTO) rules recognize that, like regulatory instruments, governments may use taxes for protectionist purposes. The rules are designed to prevent protectionist behaviour while allowing use of such instruments for genuine purposes such as environmental protection. Interestingly, however, there are some notable anomalies in the rules arising from differential evidentiary requirements in different situations. First, the rules are different depending upon whether a country's measure aims to protect on one hand human, animal, or plant health; or on the other, the environment. Second, the rules are stricter where a country's measure takes the form of a regulation than where it takes the form of a tax. The article argues that there is no principled rationale for the differential evidentiary requirements by instrument (regulation versus taxes) or area (health versus environment) but finds that there may be both a historical and political economy explanation. It also discusses the desirability for consistency in WTO law across instruments and risk-related policy areas.", 16 May 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2007, Pages 285–316, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm007
3,Independence Under Fire: Extra-legal Pressures and Coalition Building in WTO Dispute Settlement,"['John Maton', ' Carolyn Maton']","This study uses detailed quantitative analyses of the complete history of rulings made by the Panels and the Appellate Body of the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism during its first ten years of operation, to assess the robustness of theories regarding the decision-making of these institutions. Regression analyses are used to test for correlation between the success of Complainants in dispute settlement and a variety of factors, representing the hypothesized capacity of states to influence Panels and the Appellate Body through dimensions of political and economic power, the impact of the relative practical capacities of states in dispute settlement proceedings, and the formation of coalitions of states in support of a particular Complainant or Respondent. The results of the regression analyses – that few significant correlations exist between the independent variables and the dispute outcomes – provide evidence that the judicial institutions of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism are independent from Member State influence. The one reliable correlation found in these analyses demonstrates that a Complainant state does have substantial advantage in Panel proceedings if it has previously participated in more disputes than the Respondent.", 28 April 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2007, Pages 317–334, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm008
4,When do the Activities of Private Parties Trigger WTO Rules?,['Rex J. Zedalis'],"As scrutiny of government actions affecting international trade relations continues to increase, the relevance of private party actions having an impact on those relations may gain in importance. Since the 1960s, the GATT member states have been cognizant of the role that private parties can play in disrupting the natural competitive economic relationships extant between countries. A handful of GATT and WTO adjudicative determinations over the intervening four and a half decades have initiated the process of fleshing-out the conditions under which GATT/WTO legal disciplines apply to private party action as a consequence of ascribing such action to the government of a relevant member state. What follows reviews those adjudicative determinations and distills the themes and conditions for attribution articulated therein. It also reviews what could be offered GATT/WTO dispute settlement bodies were consideration to be given to the international rules regarding state responsibility for acts of individuals. From an examination of article 8 of the 2001 International Law Commission's articles on state responsibility in particular, it is suggested a somewhat narrow understanding of attribution should obtain, and that such an understanding can be seen as in conformance with the basic thrust of international economic law, extant GATT/WTO case law, and sound policy.", 11 May 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2007, Pages 335–362, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm010
5,The EU–ACP Economic Partnership Agreements and the ‘Development Question’: Constraints and Opportunities Posed by Article XXIV and Special and Differential Treatment Provisions of the WTO,['Cosmas Milton Obote Ochieng'],"This article argues that Article XXIV and special and differential treatment (SDT) provisions of the WTO present a number of constraints and opportunities to the design and scope of the proposed economic partnership agreements between the European Union (EU) and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. It examines the negotiating positions of both sides to argue that were the EU's position to prevail, ACP and other developing countries would likely suffer an ‘erosion of the development principles’ embedded within the WTO. It is shown that the differences between the two groups over the desirability and/or applicability of negotiating free trade agreements between developed and developing countries under the ‘strict’ jurisdiction of Article XXIV, and of negotiating agreements on services and the ‘Singapore Issues’, amount to a contestation over the principles of reciprocity and SDT within the WTO, and of the scope of the WTO.", 24 April 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2007, Pages 363–395, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm009
6,Compliance by WTO Members with Adverse WTO Dispute Settlement Rulings: The Record to Date,['Bruce Wilson'],"The generally positive record of Members in complying with adverse rulings by panels, the Appellate Body or both has been an important factor in the success of the WTO dispute settlement system to date. In approximately 90 percent of the adopted reports, one or more violations of WTO obligations have been found by panels and/or the Appellate Body. In virtually all of these cases the WTO Member found to be in violation has indicated its intention to bring itself into compliance and the record indicates that in most cases has already done so. It is noticeable, if not unsurprising, that compliance has been more rapid where the WTO violations can be corrected through administrative action as opposed to legislative action. A closer review of the compliance record of the United States and the European Communities, which together have been the object of approximately half of all adverse WTO rulings, shows that these Members have generally succeeded in bringing themselves into compliance with such rulings, although both Members have experienced some residual compliance difficulties in a small number of cases. As a final note, the overall positive record of Members in complying with adverse WTO rulings is reflected in, and confirmed by, the low number of cases where Members have sought and received authorization to impose retaliatory measures.", 11 May 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 2, June 2007, Pages 397–403, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm013
