0,International Legal Control of Domestic Administrative Action,['Joel P. Trachtman'],"International law increasingly is designed to constrain the regulatory activities of countries where these activities have external effects on other countries. While countries retain the right to regulate, it is a qualified right, with a number of restrictions under international trade, investment, finance, human rights, and other areas of international law. The restrictions are often nuanced: while maintaining maximum policy autonomy, countries agree to international legal rules that establish increasingly complex preconditions for national regulatory action. In some cases, preconditions are formulated so as to establish procedural, as distinguished from substantive, predicates for national action. These varying types of preconditions are often designed to be met through determinations and procedures of domestic administrative agencies, and so they form a particular variety of global administrative law: they are means by which international law harnesses and guides national administrative decision making in order to take into account the concerns of foreign countries. This article examines how these methods are used in several important examples of international legal control of domestic administrative processes, and develops a set of hypotheses regarding the circumstances under which these respective mechanisms would be used by countries.", 01 December 2014,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 17, Issue 4, December 2014, Pages 753–786, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgu045
1,Do We Need a World Financial Organization?,['Rosa M. Lastra'],"International trade law under WTO is a mature field of international economic law (IEL). In contrast, international monetary and financial law is still emerging as a discipline within IEL. With the exception of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), international monetary and financial law is still characterized by the predominance of soft law, soft obligations, and an informal institutional structure. Financial markets have become much more international in recent decades, while their regulation, supervision and—if necessary—resolution remain constrained by the domain of domestic jurisdictions. The global financial crisis has taught us several lessons. One of them is that banking crises often lead to sovereign debt crises because of the vicious link between bank debt and sovereign debt (the so-called ‘doom loop’, the catalyst for the adoption of banking union in the EU). Another lesson is that financial institutions retrench to national frontiers when things turn sour (they live globally, but die nationally). This state of affairs has to change if financial institutions and markets can remain credibly global. It is urgent and important to devise adequate international structures and international norms to govern financial markets and to control systemic risk in finance. The debate about the need for a World Financial Organization ought to be understood in this context.", 28 November 2014,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 17, Issue 4, December 2014, Pages 787–805, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgu041
