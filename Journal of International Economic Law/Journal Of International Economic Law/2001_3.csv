0,"Rules, Discretion, and Authority in International Financial Reform",['Daniel K. Tarullo'],"Proposals to reform the ‘international financial architecture’ in the wake of the global financial crisis of 1997–98 echo the traditional debate over the merits of rules versus discretion in the administration of government functions. Proposals for rules‐systems to govern International Monetary Fund (IMF)assistance and for international bankruptcy regimes promise solutions to the problems of moral hazard and collective action that contribute to financial crises, but they disregard key financial market characteristics and the differences between regulating sovereigns and private market actors. The official reform agenda eschews the rigidities of rules‐systems in favor of a mix of reforms initiated without basic changes in relevant international and national legal rights and obligations, in a way that parallels central bank policies in containing domestic financial crises. The differences in authority and credibility between national central banks and the IMF make this policy of discretionary eclecticism suspect in an international context, validating to some degree the concerns of the rules‐proponents. While some alternative approaches try to blend elements of rules‐systems and discretionary judgment, none appears likely to bridge this authority gap successfully. This circumstance reflects the problems of regulating global economic activity in a world of nation‐states and suggests that the world will remain vulnerable to damaging financial crises in the future.", 01 December 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 4, 1 December 2001, Pages 613–682, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.4.613
1,Towards Compatibility: The Future of Electronic Commerce Within the Global Trading System,['Andrew D. Mitchell'],"This article examines the key issues that electronic commerce poses for global trade, using as a starting point the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement most relevant to electronic commerce. It begins with an overview of electronic commerce, providing a workable definition of electronic commerce and examining its growth and economic impact. It then discusses the important function played by the WTO in electronic commerce, and the central role of GATS in that function. The article goes on to consider the compatibility between electronic commerce and global trade at three levels: first, at the textual level of GATS, providing recommendations to improve the treatment of electronic commerce within that agreement; secondly, at the structural level of the WTO agreements, proposing an integration of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and GATS to deal better with electronic commerce under the WTO regime; and thirdly, at the level of the global trading system, exploring how recognition of electronic commerce as a global public good may help reduce the digital divide between developed and developing countries.", 01 December 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 4, 1 December 2001, Pages 683–723, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.4.683
2,Domestic Policy and South Africa's Commitments Under the WTO's Basic Telecommunications Agreement: Explaining the Apparent Inertia,['Tracy Cohen'],"South Africa adopted the GATS Basic Agreement on Telecommunications and the regulatory principles in 1998. Obligations undertaken by South Africa mirrored the framework for the gradual telecommunications reform process that was begun in 1996. In the light of two threatened actions for anticompetitive practices in violation of the Agreement, this article reviews the nature of the commitments undertaken by South Africa and assesses the country's compliance to date. This article also seeks to explore the tension that arises between domestic policy reforms and international trade aspirations. It is argued that the dynamic produced through this tension affords domestic governments a mechanism with which to balance the seemingly opposing goals of competition and development. It is further argued that the broad regulatory principles, adopted by all signatories and often criticized for lack of precision, facilitate this fine balancing and afford domestic governments an opportunity to advance sovereign concerns while pursuing international trade ideals.", 01 December 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 4, 1 December 2001, Pages 725–754, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.4.725
3,Remedies Under WTO Law,['Patricio Grané'],"This article discusses the nature of the remedies that are available to Members of the WTO under the dispute settlement mechanism introduced by the Dispute Settlement Understanding. It will argue that the rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes under the WTO have not greatly expanded or modified the jurisdictional powers of panels when it comes to recommendations of remedial action, vis‐à‐vis the powers once exercised by panels under the GATT system. It will also show that the performance of the primary rule through the ‘withdrawal of the measures concerned where these are found to be inconsistent ’, is a prospective remedy and the primary form of reparation under the WTO dispute settlement system. It lists those instances in GATT and WTO case law where panels have braved recommendations that go beyond a mere bringing into conformity or withdrawal of the measure. To conclude, the article looks at what the future may hold and considers how much further WTO law could or should go in the field of remedial action, drawing to the extent possible from the notions of state responsibility in general international law.", 01 December 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 4, 1 December 2001, Pages 755–772, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.4.755
4,An ‘Amicus Curiae Brief’ on Amicus Curiae Briefs at the WTO,['Georg C. Umbricht'],"This article first analyses the nature of the institution of amicus curiae. Next, the article outlines different options for tackling the amicus question by the WTO dispute settlement bodies and highlights the complexities thereby entailed, drawing a distinction between policy arguments and legal arguments. If it is not through a package deal at a ministerial conference, it is less likely that actions by the political bodies of the WTO will succeed. Finally, the author concludes that amicus curiae briefs, for systemic reasons, should in the future only be allowed at the panel level, and not at the appellate level. The article further suggests that, ideally, the initial submissions of the parties should be made public ab initio in order to allow the best possible exchange with non‐governmental experts and views.", 01 December 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 4, 1 December 2001, Pages 773–794, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.4.773
