0,Re-Assessing WTO Remedies: The Prospective and the Retrospective,['Geraldo Vidigal'],"The World Trade Organization (WTO) system of ‘prospective’ or ‘forward-looking’ remedies is often contrasted negatively with the ‘retrospective’ remedy of reparation traditionally granted by international courts. In this article, I argue that prospective remedies must be assessed having in mind their different functions when contrasted to reparation: inducing compliance ex post, rather than discouraging it ex ante. The object and purpose of WTO remedies is to ensure cessation within a reasonable period of time or, in the absence of cessation, to allow alternative legal responses by the organization and its members until compliance is achieved. Although it would be beyond the current powers of WTO adjudicators to grant reparation, this does not exhaust the possibilities of ‘retrospective’ remedies. When making use of the remedies provided for in the Dispute Settlement Understanding, panels, the Appellate Body and arbitrators must take into account the ultimate objective of WTO remedies in order to ensure that the absence of reparation does not imply an absence of legal consequences.", 26 July 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 3, September 2013, Pages 505–534, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt018
1,A Dialogical Approach to Trade and Environment,['Elizabeth Trujillo'],"Traditionally, supporters of free trade and environmentalists have regarded each other as the obstacle to development, and both sides have very different views as to what constitutes development. This article considers the various dimensions to international trade governance in the context of the environment and draws from the dialogic theory in comparative constitutional law to frame trade governance regarding the environment in a new way. It uses a dialogical approach to highlight primarily three characteristics of the international trade regime that has fostered enhanced cross-fertilization of trade and environmental issues: (i) the adjudicatory capacity of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and preferential trade agreements (PTAs), (ii) the administrative capacity of the WTO and PTAs, and (iii) the fragmentary nature of trade governance. This approach highlights ways in which these three dynamics have allowed for heightened ‘cross-fertilization’ of environmental concerns into the trade framework, stimulating a form of transnational regulatory bargaining with respect to environmental issues vis-à-vis trade that reaches beyond the trade realm. Though a close look at these characteristics also illuminates the important role of free trade more generally and the WTO more specifically, in setting a normative vision of environmental sustainability, it also shows that trade regimes are limited in setting a course for addressing sustainable development. In particular, free trade says little about what constitutes sustainable development, especially when also faced with the different challenges for economic development in the developed and developing countries.", 28 August 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 3, September 2013, Pages 535–585, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt019
2,Duty Drawback and Regional Trade Agreements: Foes or Friends?,['Sherzod Shadikhodjaev'],"The nature of international trade has changed dramatically. Today, intermediate goods account for nearly 60% of the world merchandise trade, with the import content of the average export amounting to 40%. Global value chains increase the importance of duty drawback—a common practice of refunding duties on imported inputs either incorporated in finished goods for export or re-exported in the same state. Despite their great role in promoting overseas sales of products, drawback programmes have been handled under regional trade agreements (RTAs) in different ways due to a divergence of opinion on their pros and cons. This article provides a legal assessment of drawback schemes as permitted and prohibited within preferential trade areas. The main conclusion is that the no-drawback rule contained in many RTAs can have negative implications for non-parties, lacks justification under World Trade Organization’s rules, and needs to be liberalized.", 20 August 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 3, September 2013, Pages 587–611, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt020
3,Standards of Review in International Investment Law and Arbitration: Multilevel Governance and the Commonweal,"['Valentina Vadi', ' Lukasz Gruszczynski']","Investment treaty tribunals have increasingly touched upon delicate issues, including for example access to water, public health or cultural polices. What standard of review have they adopted vis-à-vis state regulation aimed to protect fundamental interests and values? Can ideas regarding the standards of review be borrowed from other national and international systems; and if so, which one should be selected? Or, rather, due to its hybrid nature investment law scholars should develop specific standards of review only for investment law and arbitration? Far from being merely theoretical, these questions touch upon the legitimacy of international investment law and arbitration as a component of multilevel governance which now characterizes international (economic) relations. Investigating these questions can contribute to the alignment of general international law and investment protection, reinforcing the capacity of international investment law to contribute to the public wealth. The article submits that while a standard of complete deference to national measures would run against the very purpose of international investment law; an overly intrusive standard is neither a feasible option. In this context the authors consider standards developed within the WTO as a possible model for international arbitration tribunals.", 22 August 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 3, September 2013, Pages 613–633, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt022
4,Remand to Fast-Track Prompt Implementation: A Critical Assessment of the ‘Double Adoption’ Remand Proposal in Chair’s Text and an Argument for a ‘Single Adoption’ Alternative,['Jaemin Lee'],"Since the DSU’s adoption of the appellate procedure in 1995, the absence of the ‘remand’ authority of the Appellate Body has caused a unique problem in the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Situations have arisen where the Appellate Body is rendered unable to complete the required analyses so as to bring finality to the disputes at hand. This recognition has made the remand issue one of the key topics in the actively ongoing DSU amendment negotiations. In 2011, the Chair of the negotiations circulated a proposed text on remand, featuring ‘double reports’ and ‘double adoption’. The ‘doubling’ feature in the proposed text, however, arguably leads to further delays and procrastination in terms of implementation by a responding Member. A remand mechanism that may undermine the ultimate objective of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism—prompt settlement of disputes following prompt implementation—would run the risk of eroding the Members’ confidence in the DSU. A ‘single report’, ‘single adoption’ remand scheme arguably offers a practical and workable alternative that ensures prompt implementation with the least disruption to the current practice of the Appellate Body.", 03 September 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 3, September 2013, Pages 635–667, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt021
5,Are Asian WTO Members Using the WTO DSU ‘Effectively’?,"['Michael Ewing-Chow', ' Alex W. S. Goh', ' Akshay Kolse Patil']","Compared to the USA, the European Union, Brazil, and Mexico, Asian World Trade Organization (WTO) members initiate fewer disputes relative to their respective stakes in global trade. They are also more likely to manifest a preference for negotiated settlements as respondents. Some have suggested that this is due to an ‘Asian culture of non-litigiousness’. This article seeks to explore this explanation as well as the fit of other explanations. We find that none of these explanations alone satisfactorily explain the current situation. We offer instead a combination of some alternative explanations by looking at the capacity to engage in WTO litigation, the domestic legal vetting processes for trade measures, industry sophistication and Asian production networks.", 31 August 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 3, September 2013, Pages 669–705, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt023
6,Energy Trade and the WTO: Implications for Renewable Energy and the OPEC Cartel,"['Paolo D. Farah', ' Elena Cima']","Energy has become increasingly important in international trade relations. However, the World Trade Organization (WTO) does not deal specifically with this sector, and this creates several problems when it comes to regulating trade in energy goods and services. The situation is further complicated, on the one hand, by the need to foster the diffusion of renewable energy to address the current environmental concerns and, on the other, by the total and overwhelming control exercised by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) over the oil market.
It is true that, recently, the WTO has shown an increasingly open approach towards environmental issues. However, free trade is still the backbone of the Organization and trade liberalization its main goal. This explains why the WTO Panel and Appellate Body are still reluctant to justify measures adopted to support the renewable energy sector that may conflict with international trade law.
Different might be the case with fossil fuels, the main competitor of renewable energy. OPEC exploits several strategies to control oil prices, which, at least in theory, clash with international trade rules. However, whatever the reason, such practices have never been challenged in front of the WTO. The way WTO provisions are interpreted and applied by the Panel and the Appellate Body when environmental concerns are involved can be used as a starting point to forecast a hypothetical judgment in case OPEC’s practices were eventually challenged.", 03 September 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 3, September 2013, Pages 707–740, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt024
