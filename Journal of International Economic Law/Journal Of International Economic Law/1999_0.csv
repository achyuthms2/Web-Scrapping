0,International economic law and the pursuit of human rights: A framework for discussion of the legality of 'selective purchasing' laws under the WTO Government procurement agreement,['C McCrudden'],"The tension between international economic law and the protection of human rights is considered. Important technical and policy aspects of the tension are illustrated by considering the legality under the WTO Government Procurement Agreement 1994 of requirements in government contracts that attempt to further social policy objectives. The current controversy concerning the use by state and local governments in the United States of 'selective purchasing' laws to influence the human rights policies of foreign governments, particularly the controversial Massachusetts legislation relating to Myanmar (Burma), provides the opportunity for considering how these tensions might be resolved.", 01 March 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 1, March 1999, Pages 3–48, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.1.3
1,The (limited) role of regulatory harmonization in international goods and services markets,['AO Sykes'],"With the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and its agreements relating to technical barriers, much attention has been devoted to the possibility of harmonizing international regulatory policies to reduce the impediments to commerce that result from regulatory heterogeneity. This paper argues that, as a normative matter, harmonization is inferior to a legal system that tolerates regulatory differences subject to legal constraints, and that relies on mutual recognition where appropriate (the exception to this claim being matters of technical compatibility between products). Related, as a positive manner, harmonization will often lack any political constituency and thus instances of true harmonization will be rare. To develop these claims, the paper carefully elucidates the unnecessary trade impediments that may result from regulatory heterogeneity, and shows how measures short of harmonization can usually address them adequately.", 01 March 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 1, March 1999, Pages 49–70, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.1.49
2,"Twenty-first century trade negotiations, the US constitution, and the elimination of US state-level protectionism",['M Schaefer'],"As international trade negotiations expand to address non-tariff barriers in the form of procurement practices, subsidies, and product standards, and new areas such as trade in services and investment, negotiators must constrain sub-federal government protectionism. Political and economic factors will drive the twenty-first century trade negotiator to seek additional constraints beyond those in current agreements. Recent US Supreme Court federalism jurisprudence has created uncertainty in the minds of negotiators as to whether the United States suffers from a constitutional incapacity to accept and implement anti-protectionism obligations and private party enforcement mechanisms with respect to US state governments. However, recent federalism jurisprudence related to the Commerce Clause, 10th Amendment, and 11th Amendment does not create any legal incapacity. Rather, negotiators will have to overcome the significant but not insurmountable political reluctance of the United States to comprehensively constrain state-level protectionism.", 01 March 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 1, March 1999, Pages 71–111, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.1.71
3,Applying GATT to marketizing economies: the dilemma of WTO accession and reform of China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs),['DM Blumental'],"This article submits that a World Trade Organization in which China plays no part is a contradiction in terms, and that the international norms that the WTO represents will not be fully accepted until the institution embraces all nations. The WTO, by granting China special dispensation, would set a positive example that conforms with, not undermines, its goal of promoting increased wealth and stability through free trade. The issue is how to bring China into the fold in a manner that causes the least disruption to all concerned. This article explores the complex and dynamic interrelationship between the WTO and the individual sovereigns comprising its leading and aspiring members. It asserts that the multilateral institution is the best forum to encourage China to build the legal institutions to guide an open economy and ease its integration into the international trading order. The problem is that existing GATT exceptions do not provide sufficient relief and that there is a strong case for granting China special treatment.", 01 March 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 1, March 1999, Pages 113–153, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.1.113
4,The CCBE resolution,['Anon'],"The following text contains observations and recommendations adopted on 26 June 1998 by the Council of the Bars and Law Societies of the European Community (CCBE) on the issue of the representation of parties and participants in WTO dispute settlement proceedings by private counsel. The CCBE fully endorses the Appellate Body's ruling in the Bananas case and points out that the right to representation by counsel of one's own choice in WTO proceedings is supported by the text of various international treaties.
The CCBE recommends that Member States should appropriately take the issue into account in the upcoming review of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. The CCBE has also drafted the 1988 Code of Conduct for Lawyers in the European Community, which has been adopted by the bar associations in the EC Member States and is being applied by some observer states to the CCBE. The CCBE has a permanent representation with the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance (CFI) exercising consultancy functions. Issues on which the CCBE advised the courts include the establishment of the CFI, the further elaboration of rules of procedure and the development of Notes for Guidance for lawyers in written and oral proceedings. The Code of Conduct itself is not part of the rules applicable before the European Court or the CFI, nor is it linked to European Community government institutions. The Code has therefore only an indirect impact on proceedings in the two courts through the binding of lawyers appearing before them to the rules of conduct of their respective domestic bars.", 01 March 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 1, March 1999, Pages 182–184, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.1.182
