0,Non-Violations,"['Robert W. Staiger', ' Alan O. Sykes']","The ‘non-violation nullification or impairment’ doctrine is among the more unique and perplexing features of WTO law. We examine the scope and application of the non-violation doctrine in the GATT/WTO. Observed cases raising non-violation claims are relatively uncommon, the non-violation claims that are observed are usually not adjudicated, and those that are adjudicated are unsuccessful in a relatively high percentage of cases. This article offers a number of reasons for the relatively modest (observed) role of the non-violation doctrine over the history of the GATT/WTO system. We report the results of a formal model developed in a companion paper, which can deliver differences in equilibrium usage of violation and non-violation claims that mirror these broad features. We note that although non-violation claims are not often observed and when observed are less successful, they can still serve a valuable role in the GATT/WTO, owing in part to their ‘off equilibrium’ effects. We develop a range of other considerations informally, which further help to explain the limited role of non-violation claims in the system and hint at some possible reforms to clarify its proper scope.", 09 December 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 4, December 2013, Pages 741–775, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt029
1,Dispute Settlement Under the WTO and RTAs: An Uneasy Relationship,['Armand C. M. de Mestral'],"The proliferation of RTAs is a recognized feature of our time. While such agreements are permitted under Article XXIV of the GATT, this has not been without controversy and one aspect which remains unclear concerns the role decisions rendered by RTA dispute settlement bodies play in WTO cases. Are RTA dispute settlement systems in competition with and possibly even in contradiction to the WTO DSU or are they complementary? Can they co-exist or are they cast in eternal opposition? Are they equal or are they inherently subordinate to the WTO DSU? The article considers the WTO’s treatment of RTAs in GATT and WTO case law, and weighs arguments for and against the consideration of RTA decisions by the DSB. The article submits that the DSB should not be blind to the equities of a situation where two states have reached an agreement in an RTA selecting dispute settlement under that body. This is more than a theoretical argument, it has happened, and the increasingly complex co-existence of the WTO with some 400 RTAs suggests that similar problems can arise in the future. Furthermore, these issues deserve a much more open and careful analysis than they have had to date.", 09 December 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 4, December 2013, Pages 777–825, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt032
2,GSP+ and Human Rights: Is the EU’s Approach the Right One?,['Bruce Wardhaugh'],"Among the purposes of the EU’s GSP+ programme is to link human rights to trade incentives, with the idea of using such incentives to promote developing countries’ adoption of the values found in core human rights treaties. With the re-renewal of the GSP (and GSP+) programmes to take effect in January 2014, it is fruitful to examine their efficacy and consistency with WTO law. In this article, I argue the GSP+ programme is not only ineffective in obtaining an improvement in human rights conditions for the vast majority of the world’s population, but it is also incompatible with WTO law. A stick-based regime where human rights abuses are linked to trade sanctions is a better way to proceed. After outlining the GSP+ system, and its linkage of human rights and trade, I analyse its efficacy and WTO consistency. Having shown that it is ineffective and contrary to WTO law, I argue that trade sanctions based on a PPM distinction and/or GATT XX(a) may be the appropriate means of linking trade and human rights. The article ends with some concluding remarks on the need for the careful design of such a system.", 09 December 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 4, December 2013, Pages 827–846, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt031
3,The Challenge of Cooperation: Regulatory Trade Barriers in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership,"['Simon Lester', ' Inu Barbee']","In the recently launched Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations between the USA and the European Union, it has been emphasized that the talks will make reducing regulatory barriers a signature issue. The emphasis on tackling these barriers has generated some excitement, with large figures being offered as estimates of the resulting economic gains. However, a good deal of uncertainty exists as to how the US–EU trade talks can address these issues, which remain largely undefined. In this regard, some key questions to ask are: What are the types of regulatory barriers at issue? How can they be addressed? And what are realistic goals for the TTIP negotiations in relation to regulations? This article examines the problem of regulatory barriers and offers an assessment of what can be achieved. The article concludes that while some claims of potential benefits are overstated, this does not mean that facilitating regulatory cooperation is not worthwhile. Negotiators should go after the low-hanging fruit, putting aside some of the more contentious USA–EU regulatory disputes, and be responsive to the needs of industry and consumers by focusing their attention on issue areas where they can have the greatest impact.", 04 December 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 4, December 2013, Pages 847–867, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt026
4,How to Kill a BIT and not Die Trying: Legal and Political Challenges of Denouncing or Renegotiating Bilateral Investment Treaties,"['Federico M. Lavopa', ' Lucas E. Barreiros', ' M. Victoria Bruno']","Arbitral tribunals’ expansive interpretation of key disciplines in international investment law in recent years has prompted a number of developing countries to implement strategies aimed at exiting the system. These range from denouncing the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (“ICSID Convention”) and withdrawing consent to jurisdiction by other arbitral bodies, to denouncing the Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) to which they are parties. The purported objective of these initiatives is to reduce the legal exposure of these countries to international claims before arbitral tribunals, either by eliminating a forum for foreign investors’ claims or by cancelling their rights under the treaties. Whether any of these strategies will be successful in meeting this goal is still hard to say, as both the ICSID Convention and BITs have ‘immune systems’—i.e. a set of built-in self-defense mechanisms—that render them somewhat resilient to change or termination. After assessing pros and cons of each of these three ‘exit strategies’, this article argues that developing States seeking to reduce the possible negative effects of international investment arbitration, would be better off by renegotiating their BITs. Renegotiation does not require the termination of the treaty, it may be implemented at any time and does not trigger the application of ‘survival clauses’, thus making changes to the BIT immediately applicable. The article thus concludes that, paradoxically, the most rational way for countries seeking to exit the system seems to be to stay in it.", 04 December 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 4, December 2013, Pages 869–891, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt025
5,"Corporate Social Responsibility, Human Rights, and the World Trade Organization",['Christian Vidal-León'],"The notion of ‘corporate social responsibility’ (CSR) has become a recurrent theme for businesses, governments, and international organizations. Under the banner of CSR, most major corporations have endorsed principles to ensure that their operations, as well as those of suppliers and subcontractors along the supply chain, are respectful of human rights standards. Yet, CSR initiatives, while pursuing laudable objectives, may create restrictions on international trade. This occurs where producers in exporting countries are compelled to adjust their business operations to meet CSR substantive and reporting requirements as a precondition for securing contracts or maintaining existing commercial relations. This article explores whether the World Trade Organization (WTO) should participate in the elaboration of disciplines in relation to the trade-restrictive effects of CSR schemes adopted by private entities. It is submitted that under Articles 2 and 3 of the TBT Agreement there may be room to consider that WTO Members are responsible for the observance of Article 2 in respect of at least certain CSR codes of conduct. This analysis concludes that although the WTO is not best equipped to address CSR measures, it should actively engage with other international organizations in the development of CSR disciplines in order to ensure that the rights and obligations of WTO Members are not affected by the proliferation of CSR codes of conduct.", 04 December 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 4, December 2013, Pages 893–920, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt030
6,Antidumping in Emerging Countries in the Post-crisis Era: A Case Study on Brazil and China,['Dan Wei'],"Traditional users and new users of antidumping are pursuing different paths. Nowadays, the trend of active use of antidumping tools has shifted from the developed countries towards the developing countries. The antidumping measures imposed by emerging economies tend to be more frequent and severe than those imposed by developed countries and South–South protectionism also emerges. Even though emerging countries like Brazil and China remain the targets of antidumping protection provided in the WTO framework, they have already acquired the capacity to use such measures and intensified their strategic employment and successfully lodged cases before the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO. The article attempts to examine and compare critically the Brazil’s and China’s use of antidumping and elucidate that emerging countries must find a way to harmonize mutually beneficial trading relationships with many other countries, if they intend to improve their leading positions in reshaping the world trading order in a way compatible with their emerging power and influence today.", 04 December 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 4, December 2013, Pages 921–958, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt027
