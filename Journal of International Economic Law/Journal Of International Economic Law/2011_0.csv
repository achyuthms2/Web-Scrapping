0,"International Economic Law, ‘Public Reason’, and Multilevel Governance of Interdependent Public Goods",['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"Is ineffective protection of international public goods, and thereby also of interrelated national public goods, the inevitable fate of humanity? The negative answer to this question in Section II argues that ineffective protection of public goods is mainly due to a lack of adequate theories, rules, and institutions for overcoming the collective action problems in multilevel governance of interdependent public goods. Section III reviews the competing conceptions of ‘international economic law’ (IEL) such as public international law approaches, multilevel economic law approaches, ‘global administrative law’ (GAL) approaches, ‘conflicts law approaches’, and ‘multilevel constitutional approaches’. Section IV argues that—similar to the experience that ‘national public goods’ can be supplied democratically only in a framework of constitutional, legislative, administrative, and judicial rules and procedures supported by domestic citizens—multilevel governance of ‘international public goods’ requires a multilevel constitutional framework for multilevel rule-making and judicial protection of rule of law and constitutional rights supported by domestic citizens as ‘primary’ legal subjects of IEL. Section V concludes that multilevel governance of interdependent public goods must no longer be designed only as ‘foreign policy’, but also as part of ‘multilevel constitutionalism’ necessary for protecting common, reasonable self-interests of all citizens and states.", 15 March 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 1, March 2011, Pages 23–76, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr005
1,Two Single Undertakings—Can the WTO Implement the Results of a Round?,['Matthew Kennedy'],"The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement was accepted as a single undertaking and the Doha Round is also treated as a single undertaking. That does not imply that any eventual results of the current negotiations can be seamlessly integrated into the existing WTO agreements all at the same time and for all Members at the same time. The procedures used to implement the results of the Uruguay Round will not necessarily be available within the constraints of the WTO’s institutional structure. Conversely, the procedures that are available within the WTO framework were not designed for the purpose of implementing the results of a comprehensive round of trade negotiations and preserving an overall balance of concessions embodied in multiple legal forms. This means that implementation will alter the multilateral nature of the WTO as it presently stands. WTO Members may yet be at liberty to revert to earlier approaches to implementation which are better adapted to the logic underlying the single undertaking approach. This paper reviews the potential form of the results of the Round as it emerges from draft modalities and texts, analyses the challenges ahead and suggests possible ways forward.", 09 March 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 1, March 2011, Pages 77–120, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr001
2,"The China–Taiwan ECFA, Geopolitical Dimensions and WTO Law",['Pasha L. Hsieh'],"This article examines legal and geopolitical aspects of the China-Taiwan Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA). It begins by analyzing areas in which the two governments’ measures contravene rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In particular, it provides the first detailed examination of the significant implications emerging from the ECFA for cross-straits trade relations and East Asian regionalism. The article also explains how the ECFA was modeled on free trade agreements (FTAs) of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and assesses the impact of the ECFA’s early harvest program. Finally, the article discusses the ECFA’s consistency with WTO requirements for an interim FTA agreement and potential legal issues arising from the dispute settlement mechanism. In this respect, the article presents a valuable case study of an FTA.", 18 March 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 1, March 2011, Pages 121–156, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr009
3,MFN-based Jurisdiction in Investor–State Arbitration: Is There Any Hope for a Consistent Approach?,['Julie A. Maupin'],"Most-favored nation (MFN) clauses are a hotly contested basis for jurisdiction in investment arbitration. This article categorizes the divergent approaches taken by 17 arbitral tribunals to date, revealing the major types of MFN clauses interpreted, the key types of MFN questions confronted and the primary reasons cited for either upholding or denying MFN-based jurisdiction. It analyzes trends emerging from the awards and attempts to explain the inconsistent outcomes in terms of the different burdens of persuasion applied by tribunals. The article concludes by exploring the feasibility of finding a more consistent approach, one which respects both the dictates of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the pragmatic concerns of investors and host states.", 28 January 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 1, March 2011, Pages 157–190, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgq052
