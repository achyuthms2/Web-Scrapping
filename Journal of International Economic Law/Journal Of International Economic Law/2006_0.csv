0,The Myth of ‘Rebalancing’ Retaliation in WTO Dispute Settlement Practice,['Holger Spamann'],"It is generally assumed that trade retaliation under the WTO performs some kind of ‘rebalancing’ by allowing the injured Member to suspend ‘concessions and obligations’ vis-à-vis the violating Member of a level equivalent to the level of ‘nullification and impairment’ suffered by the injured Member. This article argues that this perception is misguided. The article first questions if a sensible comparator exists with which equivalence for purposes of ‘rebalancing’ could be evaluated. It then argues that WTO arbitration decisions do not even succeed in their limited goal of providing for retaliation that will affect trade in the same amount as the WTO-inconsistent measure at issue. One reason is the use of an asymmetric and underspecified trade effects comparator. The other reason is very significant miscalculation of the trade effects of the violation, as shown by detailed legal-economic analysis of all relevant arbitration decisions. The decisions concerning countermeasures against prohibited export subsidies do not make any attempt at ‘rebalancing’ in the first place. The article considers political explanations of arbitration decisions. It concludes with some suggestions for improvement.", 16 February 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 1, March 2006, Pages 31–79, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi054
1,Reconstructing Embedded Liberalism: John Gerard Ruggie and Constructivist Approaches to the Study of the International Trade Regime,['Andrew T. F. Lang'],"In 1982, John Gerard Ruggie published a study of the postwar international trade and monetary regimes in which he introduced the concept of ‘embedded liberalism’. A large and growing number of international trade scholars are finding Ruggie’s concept of embedded liberalism an appealing one, and it now occupies a significant place on our conceptual horizon. In this article, the author returns to Ruggie’s original article to excavate lessons which are peculiarly relevant for current trade law scholarship. He argues that Ruggie’s account of embedded liberalism usefully serves to destabilize common assumptions about the objectives and normative underpinnings of the trade regime and thereby to expand our conceptions of what a liberal trade regime might plausibly look like. On the other hand, he explains why he does not share the enthusiasm of those who see in embedded liberalism an attractive normative vision to guide WTO reform. In addition, and most importantly, the author draws attention to the constructivist theoretical framework of Ruggie’s piece. He suggests that Ruggie’s article provides a useful introduction to the central elements of constructivist thinking about international institutions and shows how attention to constructivist insights has the potential to significantly enrich and expand our understanding of the trade regime and of trade law.", 16 January 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 1, March 2006, Pages 81–116, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi057
2,Treaty Interpretation and the WTO Appellate Body Report in US – Gambling: A Critique,['Federico Ortino'],"‘Before the game begins players should agree on a dictionary to use in case of a challenge.’ (from the Official Rules of SCRABBLE®)
Treaty interpretation in WTO law continues to represent a topic of highly theoretical and practical importance. The Panel’s and the Appellate Body’s reports in the recent US – Gambling dispute have critically turned on ascertaining the meaning of the United States’ GATS Schedule and Article XVI GATS on the basis of the public international law rules of treaty interpretation as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The paper’s principal aim is to review the interpretative approach followed in particular by the Appellate Body in reaching its decision in US – Gambling. Its main argument is that, although the Appellate Body appears to be trying to emancipate itself from a rigorous textual approach, it has not yet embraced a holistic approach to treaty interpretation, one in which the treaty interpreter looks thoroughly at all the relevant elements of the general rule on treaty interpretation pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.", 16 January 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 1, March 2006, Pages 117–148, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi052
3,"King Cotton, Developing Countries and the ‘Peace Clause’: The WTO’s US Cotton Subsidies Decision",['Karen Halverson Cross'],"Although the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a powerful vehicle for promoting economic development, the Uruguay Round has been perceived by developing country WTO members as an unequal bargain. Especially with respect to agriculture, the Uruguay Round yielded only limited concessions. In September 2003, Doha Round efforts stalled at Cancún when developing countries coalesced to oppose a proposal that insufficiently liberalized trade in agriculture. In March 2005, the Dispute Settlement Body adopted a panel decision upholding Brazil’s legal challenge of US subsidies to cotton producers. The US Cotton Subsidies decision represents a dramatic victory for Brazil and other developing country WTO members. The timing of the decision, coinciding with ongoing Doha Round agriculture negotiations, ensures that it will influence any outcome of the Round. This article examines the US Cotton Subsidies decision, describes the subsidy programs at issue in the dispute, reviews applicable WTO rules, and outlines the major findings of the panel and Appellate Body. The article concludes that Brazil’s victory in US Cotton Subsidies may represent a broader shift within the WTO away from a system dominated by the US and EC toward a system that increasingly is influenced by emerging market economies.", 30 January 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 1, March 2006, Pages 149–195, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi055
4,The Standard of Review Strikes Back: the US–Korea Drams Appeal,['Ross Becroft'],"This article contains a brief analysis of how the WTO Appellate Body identified and applied a standard of review in the recent US–Korea DRAMS Appeal and its implications for this aspect of WTO jurisprudence in the future. Section I discusses the formulation of the objective assessment test and its development through subsequent cases. Section II sets out the background to the US–Korea DRAMS decision and summarizes the reasoning of the Appellate Body in determining that the panel had not complied with its obligations under Article 11 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. Section III discusses the implications of this decision for panels and parties. It is suggested that this decision evidences the significant development of the standard of review under the WTO dispute-settlement system. However, it is suggested that the standard is becoming more complex in nature, and it may be increasingly difficult for panels to comply with Article 11 without a clear restatement of applicable principles by the Appellate Body.", 16 January 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 1, March 2006, Pages 207–217, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi056
