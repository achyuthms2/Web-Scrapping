0,Due Process and ‘Good’ Regulation Embedded in the GATS – Disciplining Regulatory Behaviour in Services Through Article VI of the GATS,['Panagiotis Delimatsis'],"On the occasion of the US – Gambling ruling, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) came to the forefront. Several critiques against this ruling highlighted the urgent need to clarify important concepts laid down in the GATS. Domestic regulation is arguably the overarching concept when it comes to trade in services, inter alia, because of the regulatory intensity that characterizes many service sectors. Article VI of the GATS aspires to discipline non-discriminatory domestic regulatory measures. In this respect, World Trade Organization (WTO) Members are required to adhere to certain due process obligations and to develop additional rules of ‘good’ regulation through the completion of the work program set out in Article VI:4 of the GATS. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Article VI. In doing this, it explores the objective function and the mechanics of this provision bearing in mind the delicate balance between trade liberalization and regulatory sovereignty that becomes apparent in Article VI more than in any other GATS provision.", 01 March 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 1, March 2007, Pages 13–50, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl035
1,Collective Security and the Economic Interventionism of the UN—the need for a coherent and Integrated Approach,['Laurence Boisson de Chazournes'],"The scope of the collective security system established under the United Nations Charter has expanded significantly since the end of the cold war to cover new fields. An increasing linkage between maintenance of peace and economic reconstruction has lead the United Nations to play an unprecedented role within the economic realm, be it by the widening of the range of measures adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter with economic consequences or through the direct management of economies in post-conflict situations as part of a global strategy to restore peace in war-torn territories. This evolution has brought to light the limits of the existing UN collective security system as a framework to deal with economic issues. It is submitted that the ‘derogatory’ logic under Article 103 of the Charter and under WTO law through its exception clauses is no longer sufficient to review and assess the UN action in the economic sphere. The promotion and integration of a broader set of principles and rules of international economic law such as principles of fair competition, non-discrimination, or transparency, would help enhance the legitimacy of actions of the UN Security Council. Moreover, this article argues that taking into account international economic law would contribute to achieve UN goals in post conflict situations by paving the way for a stable and safe economic environment in a long-term perspective. The recently established Peacebuilding Commission may contribute to develop a coherent and integrated legal approach in this area.", 27 January 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 1, March 2007, Pages 51–86, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl040
2,Export Cartels: Is there a need for Global Rules?,['Brendan Sweeney'],"One of the reasons sometimes given in support of international competition rules is the need to curb export cartels. Export cartels, however, are not necessarily competition or welfare reducing. They are just as likely to enhance competition and welfare. The evidence reveals that opinions are quite divided. However, there is one constant: no country has a strong incentive to ban export cartels unilaterally. The reason for this is that most of the adverse effects generated by the cartel are experienced abroad, not locally. Therefore, if there is a case for curbing export cartels, the alignment of incentives means that an international agreement is probably necessary. This article suggests one possible arrangement.", 14 February 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 1, March 2007, Pages 87–115, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl038
3,Connecting or Compartmentalizing the WTO and United States Legal Systems? The Role of the Charming Betsy Canon,['Arwel Davies'],"Litigants before the US courts have frequently attempted to improve their legal position by relying on the Charming Betsy canon of statutory interpretation under which statutes which can be interpreted consistently with international obligations should be so interpreted. The argument has effectively been that the canon should be permitted to provide the interface between the World Trade Organization Agreements as interpreted by the World Trade Organization tribunals, and national statutes as interpreted by US executive agencies. The ease with which the canon can be stated belies the complexity and controversy now associated with its application. Some of the cases are arguably irreconcilable while academic opinion is similarly polarized by concerns about both the extent of judicial deference to agency interpretations, and about the slightest possibility of a more inquisitive approach. This article discusses how the canon has been applied and should be applied in domestic cases with a World Trade Organization dimension. A re-conceptualization of the canon's role in cases of this type is suggested.", 23 January 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 1, March 2007, Pages 117–149, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl037
