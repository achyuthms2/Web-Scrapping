0,Developing countries and the WTO legal and dispute settlement system: a view from the bench,"['J Lacarte-Muró', ' P Gappah']","This article intends to briefly outline the role of developing countries in WTO dispute settlement as seen from the bench, that is, from the Appellate Body. More specifically, it looks at the participation of developing country Members in appellate proceedings, their contribution to the development of substantive and procedural WTO legal issues, and the provisions serving their special interests.", 01 September 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2000, Pages 395–401, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.3.395
1,Can trips serve as an enforcement device for developing countries in the WTO?,"['A Subramanian', ' J Watal']","Developing countries assert that the limited size of their markets renders conventional trade retaliatory actions by them ineffective. The complaint is that they have no effective mechanism for forcing developed countries into compliance with WTO obligations that have market access consequences for developing countries. This paper proposes a design for the use of TRIPS as a retaliatory weapon in WTO trade disputes that would overcome some of these difficulties. The proposal has many advantages: it is feasible, effective, legal, and has certain attractive attributes that are absent in conventional trade retaliation. The very presence of the threat of such retaliatory action in domestic intellectual property legislation could lead to improved compliance by developed countries.", 01 September 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2000, Pages 403–416, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.3.403
2,State-state and investor-state dispute settlement in the OECD draft multilateral investment agreement,['P Malanczuk'],"The failure of the OECD negotiations on the draft Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) has been, at least in part, attributed to its envisaged dispute settlement mechanisms. This article analyses the state-state and investor-state dispute settlement provisions of the draft MAI and argues that this criticism is based upon misunderstandings. The proposed procedures, especially the standing of private foreign investors against host states, are largely in conformity with modern developments in recent bilateral and multilateral investment protection instruments. Rather, the draft MAI failed to sufficiently clarify two substantive issues: the scope of investment protected, in particular in the pre-investment phase, as well as the complicated relationship between the MAI and dispute settlement mechanisms set out by other relevant multilateral agreements such as the WTO.", 01 September 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2000, Pages 417–439, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.3.417
3,"Judicial enforceability of WTO law in the European Union. Annotation to Case C-149/96, Portugal V. Council",['S Griller'],"Until the entry into force of the WTO Agreements, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) continuously denied the direct effect of the GATT 1947 in the European Community's legal order, in particular arguing that the GATT dispute settlement provisions were characterized by a great degree of flexibility. This case law triggered much debate and criticism, as well as high expectations of the first judgment in which the Court would assess the legal effect of WTO law. In Portugal V. Council, the ECJ did not change its general rule whereby WTO law cannot be relied on to review the legality of acts of the European Community. Setting out a two-step test, the Court first denied that the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding itself obliges the European Community to implement rulings by making them directly enforceable. Second, it denied the possibility of doing so autonomously. However, the Court upheld its case law regarding exceptions to this rule, including the possibility that WTO provisions can serve as a benchmark for reviewing Community acts taken to implement WTO Agreements.
This annotation criticizes the ECJ's reasoning, in particular the underlying assumption that WTO law lacks unconditional mandatory force, and the notion of reciprocity. It argues that the judgment is misconceived. Yet, it concludes that, inter alia, the possibility of invoking WTO provisions when reviewing the large number of measures implementing WTO Agreements might open the door towards strengthening the legal effects of WTO law in the Community.", 01 September 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2000, Pages 441–472, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.3.441
4,The GATT 1994 and other Annex 1A agreements: four different relationships?,"['E Montaguti', ' M Lugard']","Interpretative criteria and other legal tools employed in treaty interpretation are not always sufficient to resolve questions regarding the relationship between the different WTO Agreements that form a 'single package' and which entered into force on the same day. This is particularly true with respect to the various agreements relating to trade in goods. The authors analyze four possible relationships between provisions of the GATT 1994 and provisions of the other Annex 1A Agreements that have so far been identified and developed by panels and the Appellate Body: conflict, express derogation, overlap and complementarity.", 01 September 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2000, Pages 473–484, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.3.473
5,Regional integration and trade liberalization in the Southern African development community,"[""C Ng'ong'ola""]","Member States of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have recently ratified the Protocol establishing a free trade area. This is one of many integration or trading arrangements being established or revived in all regions and sub-regions of Africa. This, at the same time, is a unique arrangement. Some commentators regard Southern Africa as one sub-region of the continent with better prospects of successful integration. The SADC is also the regional organization that South Africa, the most important trading economy on the continent, first subscribed to upon its readmission into the international economic fraternity after the abolition of apartheid. This paper describes and discusses some distinctive features of the organization apparent from the SADC Treaty and Trade Protocol. The paper assesses, from an international trade law perspective, the potential contribution of such features to successful regional integration and trade liberalization in Southern Africa.", 01 September 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2000, Pages 485–506, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.3.485
6,The international monetary fund in historical perspective,['RM Lastra'],"The International Monetary Fund was set up in 1944 in a context of war, with the memories of hyperinflation, depression, and fluctuating exchange rates still fresh. The institution - though never exempt from criticism - has arguably served the international community well over the years, demonstrating a tremendous ability to adjust to new economic circumstances. Despite the abandonment of the par value regime in the 1970s, the importance of the IMF has remained undiminished. The IMF played a leading role in the sovereign debt restructuring of the LDC countries in the 1980s, in the transition to a market economy of formerly communist countries in the early 1990s, and in the resolution of financial crises in Mexico and Asia in the mid- to late 1990s, though its handling of such crises has been the subject of much controversy. This paper provides a historical primer on the IMF and considers some of the challenges the institution faces as we enter the twenty-first century. In particular, it questions the wisdom of granting the IMF a formal international lender of last resort role; it suggests that surveillance be extended beyond macro-economic policies to [micro] prudential financial supervision; and surveys the evolution and 'relaxation' of conditionality over the years.", 01 September 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2000, Pages 507–523, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.3.507
7,The Cartagena Protocol on biosafety,"['B Eggers', ' R Mackenzie']","Can a precautionary approach to biotechnology be squared with liberal trade in agriculture? This question has been running both through the transatlantic trade conflicts over the regulation and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the negotiations of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which was finally adopted in January 2000. This article provides an overview and a tentative analysis of the new environmental treaty and its relationship with WTO law.", 01 September 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2000, Pages 525–543, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.3.525
8,The Article 21.5/22 problem: clarification through bilateral agreements?,['SA Rhodes'],"To date, issues of non-compliance and retaliation have arisen in only a handful of WTO dispute settlement cases. In these cases, the parties have confronted procedural issues stemming from the lack of clarity of Articles 21.5 and 22 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. A draft DSU text has been proposed, but not adopted. Until these provisions are clarified, WTO Members continue to operate under the existing vague rules. Faced with implementation problems, the parties to disputes have resorted to bilateral agreements governing the procedures of their dispute. This note surveys these bilateral agreements, with a view to identifying the different solutions developed to resolve the interpretation of Article 21.5 and its relationship to Article 22. It focuses on three aspects of these agreements, namely, sequencing, appeal, and procedural objections.", 01 September 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2000, Pages 553–558, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.3.553
