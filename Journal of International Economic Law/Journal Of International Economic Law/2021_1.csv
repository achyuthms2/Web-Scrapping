0,Special Economic Zones in International Economic Law: Towards Unilateral Economic Law,"['Julien Chaisse', ' Georgios Dimitropoulos']","The international economic regime has entered a new phase of reassertion of sovereignty by States. While States continue to show respect for the values of international (economic) law, the institutionalization of these values has devolved from the international (to the regional) to the domestic level of governance. A new form of ‘unilateral economic law’ is thus gaining importance in the development of international and domestic laws and institutions. However, it remains largely understudied. This article discusses the development and proliferation as well as the importance of special economic zones as a new form of unilateral economic law in the overall system of international economic law. This article identifies four types of economic unilateralism: classical unilateralism, embedded unilateralism, sustainability unilateralism, and national security unilateralism. The new special economic zone unilateralism represents a middle ground between the two extremes of unilateral liberalization and aggressive unilateralism. Accordingly, special economic zone unilateralism introduces a new layer in the overall system of international economic law. First, special economic zones embody a new compromise between the State and the market. The State-controlled promotion of trade and investment taking place through special economic zones represents a complex compromise between the liberalization and protection of economic sovereignty. Second, the spatiality of trade and investment promotion through special economic zones is different from that of international economic law. The liberalization of trade and investment does not take place for the whole country but for an isolated jurisdiction within the broader national jurisdiction, while the focus is on the supply side rather than the traditional input factors of production. Overall, the new special economic zone unilateralism provides insights into the future of international economic law as envisaged by States. Special economic zones have been employed by States both as an alternative and as a complement to trade and investment promotion through the instruments of international economic law.", 18 May 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 229–257, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab025
1,"The Past, Present, and Future of Special Economic Zones and Their Impact",['Douglas Z Zeng'],"Special economic zones (SEZs) have been used by many developing countries as a policy tool to promote industrialization and economic transformation. Since the initiation of the first modern zone in Shannon, Ireland, special economic zones have evolved in many ways, from an initial ‘enclave’ nature towards today’s ‘Economic Zone 5.0’, which is built on emerging digital technologies and well integrated with urban development. The special economic zones represents a new unilateral compromise between the state and market, while still contributing to economic globalization, by presenting itself as a complementary or as an alternative approach to integrate with the global market in addition to the international economic law instruments. Despite the prevalence of special economic zones worldwide, their performance and impact on the economy and structural transformation are quite mixed. Among the many lessons learned from successful special economic zone programmes, the key elements include a strategic location, integration of zone strategy with the overall development strategy, understanding the market and leveraging comparative advantage, and, most importantly, ensuring that zones are ‘special’ in terms of a business-friendly environment—especially a sound legal and regulatory framework and an embodiment of sustainability and resiliency towards various external shocks like today’s COVID-19 pandemic.", 08 April 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 259–275, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab014
2,Financial Services Trade in Special Economic Zones,['Panagiotis Delimatsis'],"The mushrooming of special economic zones (SEZs) in recent years has led to a significant increase in the supply of attractive incentives for investors looking for opportunities abroad. Special economic zones are self-contained regimes, inextricably associated with investment promotion policies and domestic industrial policy in general, that many times form part of a broader strategic governmental planning that aims at experimenting with economic rule-making in strictly defined territorial and jurisdictional boundaries. While empirical evidence is still inconclusive, special economic zones can contribute to economic development at the domestic level through a varying degree of channels. This is even more the case with services-only special economic zones, a new phenomenon that exemplifies the rising importance of trade in services but also the ‘servicification trend’ that drives global economic activity. Against this background, this article examines the case of services in special economic zones and offers a tour d’horizon of the current services-related special economic zone landscape. Furthermore, the article critically reviews the patterns, traits, and limits of trade in financial services within special economic zones and discusses the relevance of the General Agreement on Trade in Services at this juncture. It concludes with a discussion of potential development-related benefits ensuing from trade in financial services within special economic zones.", 18 May 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 277–297, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab023
3,The Latest Generation of SEZs: Consumer-Oriented Unilateralism in China’s E-Commerce Trade,['Jie (Jeanne) Huang'],"World Trade Organization multilateralism is driven by manufacturers. However, in China, Cross-border E-commerce Retail Import has spurred a new, consumer-oriented trade unilateralism. Cross-border E-commerce Retail Import prospers within China’s National Cross-Border E-commerce Pilot Cities, which are special economic zones aimed at using unilateral trade liberalization to meet consumers’ growing demands for high-quality foreign products. Cross-border E-commerce Retail Import enhances consumer benefits beyond reducing customer formalities and tax rates and lowering product prices. It re-conceptualizes consumer protection by treating consumers as diverse individuals rather than as a homothetic group. It also empowers consumers by making them ‘importers’ to minimize behind-the-border trade barriers. Cross-border E-commerce Retail Import warrants a rethinking of World Trade Organization multilateralism from its initial focus on corporations and capital owners to a revised focus on consumers.", 28 April 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 299–320, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab018
4,"Investor Obligations in Special Economic Zones: Legal Status, Typology, and Functional Analysis","['Joanna Lam', ' Rui Guo']","The article discusses various types of investor obligations in special economic zones and examines how they are utilized as instruments for devising development policies. It presents the evolution of regulatory models and practices related to investor obligations in the context of the unilateral character of the legal framework of the zones. The article distinguishes between two types of investor obligations. The first includes commitments focused on quantifiable aspects of economic performance of the investor in the host country, such as the maintenance of a pre-determined level of investment or the creation of a specific number of jobs. The second category of investor obligations is those containing qualitative goals that contribute to the host country’s developmental objectives, such as workforce welfare commitments, environmental standards, and technology transfers. Case studies of Shenzhen, Poland, and Tanzania are analysed to demonstrate how relevant regulatory practices have evolved over time. The case studies are drawn from three different phases of the global proliferation of special economic zones and reflect the regional diversity of the zones.", 16 April 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 321–340, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab011
5,Labour Rights in Special Economic Zones: Between Unilateralism and Transnational Law Diffusion,"['Lorenzo Cotula', ' Liliane Mouan']","Special economic zones (SEZs) have spread rapidly over the past 20 years, including in many low- and middle-income countries keen to attract private investment for industrial development. But while much debate has focused on their economic performance and success factors and on links with the wider architecture of international economic law, there are enduring concerns over respect for labour rights in SEZs. These concerns are partly rooted in features of the legal regimes that underpin SEZs, such as arrangements that qualify the application of ordinary labour law, or ineffective systems to ensure compliance. This article discusses the law governing labour rights in SEZs, drawing on the case studies of Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Kenya—three countries reflecting different generations of SEZ legislation, types of SEZs, and regulatory approaches. The article explores the complex interplay of different ‘unilateral’ and international legal regimes, the structural features that affect labour rights in SEZs, and possible ways forward for research and practice.", 10 April 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 341–360, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab012
6,International Commercial Courts in the ‘Modern Law of Nature’: Adjudicatory Unilateralism in Special Economic Zones,['Georgios Dimitropoulos'],"International commercial courts are currently proliferating from the last generation special economic zones of the Gulf region to the whole of Asia and Europe. International commercial courts are institutions of a new era of international economic law and adjudication. Zone courts, alongside the new uses of arbitration within special economic zones, may be viewed as the adjudicatory counterpart of the move towards unilateralism in international economic law. The idea is to move cases from the international to the domestic realm and overall domesticate international economic law and adjudication. The unilateral strategy to achieve this is the introduction of new courts that sit in a space between the national and the international and are based on English (common) law. However, the new system does not oblige the transferal of cases. The special economic zones-driven judicial unilateralism adds an investment attraction to the repertoire of states, as well as choices to parties. Adjudicatory unilateralism is thus consubstantially plural. The creation and proliferation of English (common) law-based special economic zones and international commercial courts is a major shift that will have deep implications for the system of international economic law and adjudication.", 19 April 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 361–379, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab017
7,The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and Unilateralism of Special Economic Zones,['Sherzod Shadikhodjaev'],"Many governmental incentives unilaterally offered in special economic zones affect competition in international markets and thus fall within the scope of the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Until very recently, products made in such zones could face countervailing duty investigations abroad on a charge of improper subsidization. In 2019, the World Trade Organization issued its first ruling focusing on the legality of certain special economic zone subsidies. In particular, the panel in India—Export Related Measures found fiscal preferences under an Indian scheme to be prohibited export subsidies. This article examines the status of special economic zone incentives under the multilateral subsidy regime, discusses the relevant anti-subsidy practice, and identifies ‘risky’ and ‘safe’ types of support measures that constitute unilateralism of zones in promoting economic activities.", 10 April 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 381–402, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab013
8,WTO Litigation and SEZs: Determining the Scope of Exceptional Trade Unilateralism,"['James J Nedumpara', ' Manya Gupta', ' Leïla Choukroune']","The incentives available to enterprises located in special economic zones can be classified into three broad categories, namely, (i) fiscal incentives in the nature of tax incentives and exemption of duties, (ii) non-fiscal incentives in the form of infrastructural and developmental facilities, and (iii) regulatory incentives covering lenient and flexible compliance requirements. The fiscal incentives in special economic zones are, to an extent, regulated by the law of the World Trade Organization although direct challenges of special economic zone policies have been very few or non-existent. The absence of legal challenges led to a number of World Trade Organization members pursuing unilateral trade policies within their special economic zones. However, the recent World Trade Organization Panel findings in India—Export Related Measures appear to highlight the thin margin for trade unilateralism especially in relation to fiscal incentives in special economic zones. In the above context, this article examines the permissible limits of trade unilateralism, in the context of special economic zones, by providing a fresh understanding of the disciplines under international trade law and the available jurisprudence. It focuses, in particular, on the precise contours of permissible trade unilateralism exercised by World Trade Organization members when granting fiscal incentives. In doing so, this article also examines the concept of exception as a manifestation of unilateralism in International Economic Law.", 04 May 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 403–422, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab020
9,Regulation of Special Economic Zones Through Regional Trade Agreements: Confronting the Synergy Issue,['Manjiao Chi'],"Special economic zones (SEZs) and regional trade agreements (RTAs) are frequently used by states as policy tools to promote economic development. As SEZs and RTAs overlap in geographical coverage and regulation areas and are implemented in parallel, they could create profound synergies. As there is no specialized international legal framework for SEZ regulation, and national SEZ laws seldom touch upon the synergy issue, SEZ regulation is largely left to RTAs at the international level. Yet, existing SEZ-related provisions in RTAs almost exclusively focus on trade in goods and appear insufficient in addressing the synergy issue—especially ‘new synergies’ created by ‘advanced SEZs’ and ‘deep RTAs’. To properly address the synergy issue, states should treat SEZ policy-making and RTA rule-making in a coordinated way and consider adopting a regional or multilateral approach in SEZ regulation.", 20 April 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 423–442, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab016
10,"Dangerous Liaisons: The Story of Special Economic Zones, International Investment Agreements, and Investor–State Dispute Settlement",['Julien Chaisse'],"This article focuses on the interaction and relationship between Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as facets of unilateral economic law, international investment law, and the investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS) system in a four-fold manner. It initially explains the role of international investment agreements in protecting foreign investments in these zones. Then, it classifies the public or private nature of such zones and goes on to examine related claims through past case law, to determine how modern SEZs must be created to reduce host State liability. Whilst doing so, it provides important suggestions to improve the domestic and international success of SEZs by reducing costs associated with it. In this manner, this article endeavours to highlight the need for a balance in public policy between the rights of host States and foreign investors to ensure that SEZs continue to attract significant amounts of foreign investment. It also stresses on understanding transnational foreign investment rules and the implication of the previously concluded investor–ISDS proceedings so that host States can ensure better regulation of foreign direct investment in these areas.", 04 May 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 443–471, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab015
11,"Special Economic Zones Facing the Challenges of International Taxation: BEPS Action 5, EU Code of Conduct, and the Future","['Frederik Heitmüller', ' Irma Mosquera']","Corporate taxation and particularly corporate tax incentives that jurisdictions introduce in special economic zones have not, until recently, been subject to extensive international regulation. Only in the last decade has a regime of soft law standards and European Union measures with extraterritorial effect been constructed. This article explains how the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Union Code of Conduct for Business Taxation interact with corporate tax incentives in special economic zones. Empirical evidence from Latin American and Caribbean jurisdictions shows that this emerging international regime began having an impact on special economic zone laws beyond the OECD and European Union Member States. An analysis of ongoing negotiations on the further developments of the international tax regime permits the cautious conclusion that the regulation of SEZs may in the future be affected in a more fundamental manner by international norms. Thereby, the article shows that special economic zones’ unilateralism in corporate taxation may be slowly receding in contrast to other areas of international economic governance.", 22 April 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 473–490, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab019
12,From Ideas to Action: Governance Paths to Net Zero,['Bradly J Condon'],"The California wildfire disaster of 2018 and the Texas power disaster of 2021 provided stark reminders that inadequate climate risk management can have serious consequences for corporations.1 PG&E’s outdated electric infrastructure sparked fires in the drought-primed California forests, which ultimately led to its criminal convictions for manslaughter, civil litigation, and bankruptcy.2 Unusually severe winter weather in Texas revealed weaknesses in the Texas electricity grid, causing blackouts, deaths, disruptions to Coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) vaccine distribution, suspension of fossil fuel production, and criminal investigations.3 Civil lawsuits and regulatory changes are likely to follow.
The climate crisis is a systemic risk that will manifest itself across a broad spectrum over many decades. Climate change threatens human societies, economies, and planetary ecosystems. Climate change also creates significant financial risks for publicly held company valuations and investment portfolios. Fossil fuel reserves risk becoming stranded assets.

13,Research Handbook on Feminist Engagement with International Law,['Erica Coray'],"This review analyzes the efficacy of the collection in engaging with international law through the lens of feminist jurisprudence. The editors have compiled a diverse collection that applies feminist thought to varying topics of international law, including economic topics that do not obviously lend themselves to feminist engagement, that demonstrates the benefits of such analysis. The handbook effectively illustrates the potential for feminist thought to apply broadly to international law topics and provides a path forward for continued engagement with feminist theories in international law.", 04 May 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 497–501, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab022
14,"A Post-WTO International Legal Order: Utopian, Dystopian and Other Scenarios",['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"In their Preface, the editors explain how the 16 chapters of this excellent book resulted from a series of conferences on what might be the consequences or potential responses if the World Trade Organization (WTO) collapsed or became largely irrelevant. The book project ‘was premised on the view (i) that the WTO and its commitment to a rule-of-law form of multilateralism is worth saving, even if it is not perfect and even if it needs some substantial reform and (ii) that the insights generated by exploring a post-WTO world, in both dystopian and utopian perspectives, would likely be helpful in trying to save the WTO from potential collapse or stagnation’ (p. v). The Introduction by J. Nakagawa and C.B. Picker explains these conference objectives in more detail, for instance, by listing what some observers might view as ‘fundamental negative features of the WTO’, ‘successful aspects of the WTO’, the ‘horrors...", 07 January 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 2, June 2021, Pages 509–514, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa044
