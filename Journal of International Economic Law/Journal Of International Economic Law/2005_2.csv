0,Effective Global Economic Governance by the World Trade Organization,"['Peter Van den Bossche', ' Iveta Alexovičová']","The World Trade Organization (‘WTO’) is the principal international institution for the management and regulation of the process of economic globalization. Its effectiveness in fulfilling this important task, however, leaves much to be desired. On 4 and 5 February 2005, the Faculty of Law of Maastricht University organized an international research conference entitled ‘ In Search of Effective Global Economic Governance: The Case of the World Trade Organization ’. This conference brought together academics, WTO officials, government diplomats, national trade officials, representatives of business associations and NGOs to discuss a wide range of issues, including: possible improvements to and alternatives for consensus decision-making in the WTO; issues of transparency, democratic legitimacy and the participation of civil society in WTO decision-making; secondary law-making by WTO bodies; and an expanded role for the WTO Secretariat. It is important that legal and political science scholars focus their research efforts on the reforms needed to transform the WTO into an instrument of effective global economic governance. The main objective of the conference was, therefore, to define a comprehensive agenda for research into the institutional reform of the WTO. This article is, above all, a report of the conference and summarizes the main arguments made by the participants.", 01 September 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 3, September 2005, Pages 667–690, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi039
1,‘Good Faith’ in the WTO Jurisprudence – Necessary Balancing Element or an Open Door to Judicial Activism?,['Helge Elisabeth Zeitler'],"The purpose of the article is two-fold: first, it seeks to clarify and structure those contexts in which the principle of good faith has entered the WTO jurisprudence; and second, it presents an analysis of the potential effects and risks accompanying this entrance, such as the allegation of judicial activism on the part of the panels or the Appellate Body and the viability of a distinction between violation and non-violation cases. It attempts to define the framework within which a suitable concept for the application of good faith must be found and explores the conclusion that thus far the Appellate Body has applied good faith with the necessary caution. However, it cautions the necessity of avoiding an overbroad use of the concept and mandates the requirement for the judicial bodies to articulate more clearly the content attributed to the concept in a particular case and the legal consequences thereof than it has done thus far. Finally this article urges the judicial bodies to avoid the idea of an abstract obligation of good faith that adds something to the obligation under the WTO Agreements. This would accord with the traditional international law understanding of what the application of the good faith principle implies.", 01 September 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 3, September 2005, Pages 721–758, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi043
