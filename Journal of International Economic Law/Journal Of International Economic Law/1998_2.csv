0,Dispute settlement and the WTO,['JH Jackson'],"This article briefly examines the developing jurisprudence of the new WTO dispute settlement system as expressed in the Appellate reports of the first three and one-third years. It suggests some tentative generalizations about the Appellate Body approach, including a possible greater spirit of deference to national government regulatory decisions, to allow greater margins of leeway for those decisions than sometimes indicated in first-level panel reports or in later-year GATT panel reports. The author also notes some constitutional dangers of a tendency for the WTO diplomacy to rely too heavily on the dispute system to correct the many ambiguities and gaps in the new trading system Uruguay Round texts.", 01 September 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 3, September 1998, Pages 329–351, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.3.329
1,"Technology, trade, and increasing inequality: does the cause matter for the cure?",['AV Deardorff'],"This paper addresses an issue that has received a great deal of attention in recent years, both from international trade economists and from labor economists: What has caused the relative wage of skilled labor compared to unskilled labor in the USA to increase through the 1980s and 1990s? Prime candidates for causing this change have been 'trade' - the increased competition of US workers with unskilled workers abroad - and 'technology' - new products and processes that may have increased the productivity of skilled workers or skill-intensive industries relative to their unskilled counterparts. The paper reviews what has happened to relative wages and the explanations that have been suggested. A brief look at the empirical evidence from this literature is suggestive, but hardly conclusive. But the paper then asks whether the answer to this question really matters. It turns out that the appropriate policies for dealing with this change in relative wages do not depend on whether the cause of the change has been trade or technology. The paper concludes with an argument about the first-best policy for dealing with the increased wage differential, but also with some skepticism that any policy at all is needed.", 01 September 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 3, September 1998, Pages 353–376, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.3.353
2,Preliminary assessment of the effects of the WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary trade regulations,['D Roberts'],"Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures that regulate movement of products across international borders are necessary to protect public health or the environment, but may also be used to protect domestic producers from international competition. The recent WTO Agreement on the Application of SPS Measures aims to create a set of multilateral trade rules which allows the legitimate use of trade regulations for health and environmental protection, while disallowing their use for mercantilist regulatory protectionism. This paper examines WTO jurisprudence, negotiated settlements of formal complaints, and unilateral implementation of Agreement's provisions since its entry into force to evaluate whether and how the Agreement has served the interests of the world trading system.", 01 September 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 3, September 1998, Pages 377–405, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.3.377
3,Legal means to protect private parties' interests in the WTO. The case of the EC new trade barriers regulation,"['PC Mavroidis', ' W Zdouc']","The WTO contract is essentially a government contract with important repercussions on private parties' interests. WTO Members enjoy wide discretion when it comes to regulating the way in which private interests will be represented; the WTO contract itself imposing only an obligation to perform the WTO contract in good faith. In principle, three solutions seem legally possible: WTO Members recognize direct effect to the WTO rules and consequently allow private parties to invoke WTO rules before national courts; WTO Members do not recognize any direct effect on the WTO rules and continue to be the sole judges of whether private parties' interests should be represented before the WTO adjudicating bodies; recently, in the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, the so-called 'challenge procedures' were agreed whereby WTO Members would allow private parties to check whether government behaviour in the field of government procurement is in conformity with the relevant WTO rules. This paper argues that since the first option is still 'wishful thinking' and the third option is limited, for the time being, strictly to government behaviour, private parties' interests will continue to be represented for some time by governments. Hence, the need to study such instruments and their evolution. We propose a comparative study of the two most elaborate instruments in this respect (the EC and the US instruments) and draw the conclusion that over time they have become more responsive to private parties' concerns but that they can by no means be construed as perfect substitute of the other two options.", 01 September 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 3, September 1998, Pages 407–432, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.3.407
4,The misguided debate over NGO participation at the WTO,['JL Dunoff'],"Whether private parties and NGOs should participate in the WTO system has recently become one of the most contentious issues in trade law and policy. However, this debate proceeds from the implicit - but mistaken - assumption that these entities currently do not participate in the system. While, as a formal matter, WTO 'legislative' and dispute resolution systems are open only to state actors, in fact private parties already participate extensively in WTO processes. Through discussion of several WTO disputes, including the Kodak-Fuji dispute, this paper demonstrates how the current debate substantially understates the considerable roles that NGOs already play in disputes submitted to the WTO. The claims here are largely positive and descriptive, rather than normative. By identifying and clarifying the roles that private parties currently play, I hope to close the increasing gulf between academic debate and WTO practice, and move the debate over NGO participation to a more fruitful series of inquiries. To this end, I argue that the controversy over NGO participation at the WTO can be understood as a particular instantiation of a larger debate over the roles of non-state actors in the international legal system.", 01 September 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 3, September 1998, Pages 433–456, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.3.433
5,Investment issues at the WTO: the architecture of rules and the settlement of disputes,"['TL Brewer', ' S Young']","This paper analyses the treatment of investment issues at the World Trade Organization (WTO), with an emphasis on foreign direct investment (FDI). The investment-related provisions of four agreements are evaluated: the agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs), the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), and the agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCMs). In fact only the GATS has significantly expanded coverage of FDI issues directly, though with many sectoral exceptions in the schedules of national commitments. An analysis of 115 dispute cases that entered the WTO dispute settlement process during 1995-97, plus 325 cases at the GATT during 1948-94, indicates that although investment issues are receiving more attention in the WTO than in the GATT, there have thus far been relatively few investment issues explicitly raised in WTO disputes. A consideration of the prospects for the evolution of investment issues at the WTO during the next several years suggests that they will receive increasing attention, especially within the context of reviews of the TRIMs agreement and the GATS.", 01 September 1998,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 1, Issue 3, September 1998, Pages 457–470, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/1.3.457
