0,The Future of the WTO: The Case for Institutional Reform,['Debra P. Steger'],"Institutional reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is needed to equip it for the challenges of the future. However, the major problem with rule making and decision making in the WTO is not the consensus rule or the decision-making rules in the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the WTO. It is not the final phase of adoption of a rule-making proposal that causes the delays and blockage in the WTO system, but rather the lack of formal mechanisms at the initial and intermediate stages of the rule-making process and the absence of a management or executive body, analogous to the executive boards of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, that leads to the lack of direction and drift in the Organization. This article maintains that it is necessary to establish a formal, limited-membership management committee or executive board within the WTO. The roles of the Director-General and the Secretariat of the WTO should also be enhanced. The WTO has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability vis-à-vis NGOs and civil society. Developing a parliamentary dimension to the WTO would go a long way to remedying these deficiencies. Finally, the idea of developing more formal mechanisms for receiving input from non-state stakeholders, with an emphasis on business and consumer groups, should be explored.", 10 September 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 803–833, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp032
1,The WTO Single Undertaking as Negotiating Technique and Constitutive Metaphor,['Robert Wolfe'],"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO) proceed simultaneously, not sequentially, and all Members must accept all the results. I show that the so-called Single Undertaking is both a negotiation technique and a constitutive metaphor. It does not cause an outcome to negotiations, whether in a round or the daily life of the WTO, but it shapes the possibility of an outcome. The methodological innovation of the article is the use of counterfactual analysis to assess whether the Single Undertaking can be relaxed using concepts suggested by the various critiques. I consider rounds of negotiations, the consensus principle, diffuse reciprocity, critical mass decision making, the WTO acquis and special and differential treatment for developing countries. One aspect of integrative bargaining strategies, issue linkage, is also considered. The Single Undertaking emerged in the interaction structured by the regime, and the same process could lead to it being eliminated, but that is unlikely.", 18 December 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 835–858, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp038
2,"Prudence or Discrimination? Emergency Measures, the Global Financial Crisis and International Economic Law","['Anne van Aaken', ' Jürgen Kurtz']","Economists and political scientists have begun to isolate the causes and implications of the spread of the global financial crisis in late 2008. Critical attention—often accompanied by strident disagreement—has also focused on the efficacy of various domestic plans implemented in response to the crisis. International economic lawyers have started to explore the legal implications of these developments. Our analysis offers a contribution by examining whether and how certain aspects of international economic law might act as a credible constraint on state tendencies toward domestic preference when formalizing emergency responses to the crisis. We begin by offering a typology of emergency measures implemented to date. We then assess whether particular international economic law rules can target the nuanced forms of protectionism embedded in those responses. We survey both treaty commitments on trading relations (especially under the World Trade Organization) and the treatment of foreign investors. We argue that international investment law is, in the short term due to legal and extra-legal factors, more likely than any other area of international economic law to give rise to initiation of legal action and examine the most probable substantive norms likely to be violated.", 18 December 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 859–894, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp041
3,Climate Change and Unresolved Issues in WTO Law,['Bradly J. Condon'],"This article analyzes several unresolved issues in World Trade Organization (WTO) law that may affect the WTO-consistency of measures that are likely to be taken to address climate change. How should the WTO deal with environmental subsidies under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Agreement on Agriculture and the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement? Can the general exceptions in GATT Article XX be applied to other agreements in Annex 1A? Are processing and production methods relevant to determining the issue of ‘like products’ in GATT Articles I and III, the SCM Agreement and the Antidumping Agreement and the TBT Agreement? What is the scope of paragraphs b and g in GATT Article XX and the relationship between these two paragraphs? What is the relationship between GATT Article XX and multilateral environmental agreements in the context of climate change? How should Article 2 of the TBT Agreement be interpreted and applied in the context of climate change? The article explores these issues.", 24 September 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 895–926, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp033
4,"Proportionality, Proximity and Environmental Labelling in WTO Law",['Ilona Cheyne'],"Consumer information labelling is a vital part of modern environmental regulation, which has significant advantages over traditional command and control and market mechanism approaches. However, labelling has been accused of distorting competitive conditions by promoting discrimination between imported and domestic like products and by misleading consumers about certain types of products. The problem is qualitatively different from other types of trade dispute because labelling speaks directly to the consumer and her role within freely operating markets. The conflict has become entrenched in textual and ideological disagreements and demands a new approach that acknowledges the importance of providing consumers with information about the environmental implications of their purchasing decisions, while continuing to protect the rights of exporting WTO Members. This article explores the nature of consumer information labelling in regulatory theory and environmental law and policy, and develops an analytical framework that may help to break the current deadlock. This points towards the use of a proportionality approach with particular emphasis on the distance between consumers and the transboundary impacts of their purchasing choices.", 18 December 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 927–952, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp040
5,"The WTO and Regulatory Freedom: WTO Disciplines on Market Access, Non-Discrimination and Domestic Regulation Relating to Trade in Goods and Services",['Erich Vranes'],"This article addresses the question as to how the principal World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations on market access relate to those on non-discrimination and domestic regulation. This issue has appropriately been referred to as ‘the single most potent underlying source of legal and political tension in all free trade regimes’.1 The present contribution focuses on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), but by way of introduction it also briefly addresses pertinent WTO rules on trade in goods, so as to delineate a background against which the considerably more complicated legal situation in the GATS can be compared.", 27 October 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 953–987, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp034
6,The New Text of the Agreement on Government Procurement: An Analysis and Assessment,['Arie Reich'],"This article describes and analyzes the new, tentatively agreed text of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement; and it compares this text with the existing agreement of 1995, offers interpretation of its provisions and discusses its potential implications for the regulation of international government purchasing. The objective of the article is to examine whether the new text has indeed delivered on its promise, namely to improve the existing agreement and to eliminate any remaining discriminatory measures and practices. To that aim the article presents the critique that has been leveled against the provisions of the existing GPA and examines to what extent the flaws detected by this critique have been rectified in the new text. The article concludes with a scorecard of the new text assessing its overall strengths and weaknesses.", 18 December 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 989–1022, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp037
7,Challenging Trips-Plus Agreements: The Potential Utility of Non-Violation Disputes,['Susy Frankel'],"A World Trade Organization (WTO) non-violation complaint is one where an agreement has not been breached, but the complainant alleges an expected benefit under the agreement has been abrogated. When the TRIPS Agreement came into force non-violation complaints were not available for TRIPS disputes. This position was to be reviewed. Non-violation complaints remain unavailable for TRIPS disputes. In the early days of TRIPS the exclusion of non-violation disputes seemed rational because of the unique nature of TRIPS, among WTO agreements. The TRIPS Agreement requires members to implement minimum standards of intellectual property protection in their national laws. Members therefore have to provide at least that level of protection. If they do not do so a violation complaint could be initiated. Consequently, it was not logical to look for any notion of expected benefit beyond the wording of the minimum standards. However, TRIPS permits members to have greater standards and many members have agreed to higher standards through free trade agreements. These TRIPS-plus standards have arguably undermined expected benefits that should flow from TRIPS, especially for users of intellectual property rights. This article discusses the utility of making non-violation disputes available for TRIPS disputes from the perspectives of both the users and owners of intellectual property rights. This analysis includes a discussion of whether TRIPS-plus free trade agreements undermine expected benefits of the TRIPS Agreement and should thus be the subject of a non-violation dispute.", 18 December 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 4, December 2009, Pages 1023–1065, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp039
