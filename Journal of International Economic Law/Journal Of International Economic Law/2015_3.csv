0,Can Informal Law Discipline Subsidies?,"['Gregory Shaffer', ' Robert Wolfe', ' Vinhcent Le']","Some subsidies (such as for fossil fuels and fisheries) adversely affect global public goods (such as a stable climate and the maintenance of global fish stocks); others affect global price levels (domestic support for certain agriculture commodities), or have negative consequences for a trading partner. World Trade Organization (WTO) members have negotiated an agreement on subsidies, but there are severe limits to that agreement’s ability to exercise discipline, and the prospects of its amendment remain limited. This article examines whether states can improve discipline through the use of informal mechanisms and, if so, under what conditions. Informal discipline on subsidies depends on the existence of fora to discuss definitions, generate information about their incidence, discuss whether a particular measure fits the definition, and consider whether a remedy exists. This article takes international organizations (IOs) seriously as fora for generating ‘law’, not simply as bodies exercising power or coercion, and it explores a particular view of law. If codification is not the only indicator of law, if one accepts that law also emerges in social interaction, then we must attend to the less formal places where the law of subsidies emerges, and affects state actions. The analysis of where disciplines might be found is based on a three-level set of comparisons: (i) within the WTO, involving horizontal compared to sectoral disciplines, with a focus on committee and other peer-review processes, rather than the traditional focus on the dispute settlement system; (ii) the WTO compared to, and in complement with, other IOs addressing particular sectors; and (iii) IOs compared to, and in complement with, non-governmental organizations. The article provides four case studies involving subsidies: (i) export credits, (ii) shipbuilding, (iii) fisheries, and (iv) fossil fuels. It assesses variations in number of actors, the conceptualization of the problem, definitions, obligation, data, and organizations across these case studies and the impact of such differences on the development of subsidy disciplines.", 17 December 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 4, December 2015, Pages 711–741, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv043
1,How Some Countries Became ‘Special’: Developing Countries and the Construction of Difference in Multilateral Trade Lawmaking,['Nicolas Lamp'],"This article investigates the origins of the ‘special’ status of developing countries in multilateral trade lawmaking, and traces the form that their special treatment has taken throughout the history of the trade regime. The article takes issue with the influential view that the special treatment of developing countries stemmed primarily from their desire to be exempted from the legal disciplines of the trade regime. Instead, I argue that many aspects of the special treatment of developing countries in the trading system are best explained as manifestations of the desire of developed countries to accommodate the developing countries within the trading system without changing the fundamental features and default characteristics of the system. Granting exemptions and special treatment to developing countries has allowed the developed countries to preserve their preferred design of the trade regime, and to stick to their favoured method of making trade law, while keeping developing countries within the system. I derive this argument from a detailed analysis of three formative episodes in the history of multilateral trade lawmaking: the debate about the treatment of quantitative restrictions at the GATT/ITO preparatory conferences in the late 1940s; the emergence of the principle of less-than-full reciprocity in tariff negotiations in the late 1950s and 1960s; and the developing countries’ resistance to the TRIPS Agreement in the Uruguay Round. The article concludes by exploring whether the special treatment of developing countries in the new Agreement on Trade Facilitation represents a departure from this pattern.", 27 November 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 4, December 2015, Pages 743–771, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv040
2,The Unique Features of the Trade Facilitation Agreement: A Revolutionary New Approach to Multilateral Negotiations or the Exception Which Proves the Rule?,['Ben Czapnik'],"The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) has received much attention for its unique approach to special and differential treatment, especially the ability of developing countries to self-designate their implementation periods and technical assistance needs. However, the Agreement contains other unique features which, though they have received less attention from commentators, may turn out to be more significant for multilateral rulemaking. Most notably, the self-designation and categorization of measures result in each developing country taking a Member-specific approach to its TFA commitments. While a Member-specific approach to market access commitments has been commonplace since the original GATT, rules commitments have tended to have a broad application to all Members or, where some differentiation of Members is used, to broad groups of Members based on objective criteria. In this sense, the TFA may have broken the mould for how rules commitments are negotiated. This article explores whether the TFA could open the door for Member-specific approaches to other rules areas at the WTO. With the current deadlock in multilateral trade negotiations, this aspect of the TFA may provide a template for negotiators to seek more nuanced and balanced outcomes for other rules negotiations such as anti-dumping.", 20 November 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 4, December 2015, Pages 773–794, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv041
3,Evidentiary Challenges for Public Health Regulation in International Trade and Investment Law,['Tania Voon'],"Recent challenges to public health regulation such as Indonesia’s challenge to the USA’s tobacco flavouring ban in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the WTO and investment treaty challenges to Australia’s plain tobacco packaging scheme, have raised common problems of evidence in the international trade and investment law regimes. Responding states are faced with high expectations in justifying their public health measures with empirical evidence connecting the measure with its purported health outcomes. This article compares approaches to evidence in international trade and investment law and seeks to derive lessons for policymakers in developing public health regulation with potential trade and investment treaty challenges in mind. The article reflects on the kinds of evidence needed to successfully defend such challenges and the appropriate approach to assessing such evidence in disputes in these two fora.", 28 November 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 4, December 2015, Pages 795–826, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv044
4,The Evolution of Labor Rights and Trade—A Transatlantic Comparison and Lessons for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership,['Jeffrey S. Vogt'],"This article surveys the differing approaches of the US and the EU on trade and labor linkage and evaluates the extent to which either model has had a meaningful impact on the protection of workers’ rights in the territory of their trade partners. It finds that pre-ratification leverage has resulted in legislative reforms, particularly as demanded by the US, though post-ratification efforts have been much less successful. The article identifies the possible reasons therefore and concludes with recommendations to overcome these weaknesses in the context of the US-EU bilateral trade agreement negotiations for the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.", 06 January 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 4, December 2015, Pages 827–860, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv046
5,Reforming the International Investment Regime: Lessons from International Trade Law,"['Frank J. Garcia', ' Lindita Ciko', ' Apurv Gaurav', ' Kirrin Hough']","International trade law underwent a profound paradigm shift during the 1990’s and into the 21st century as a response to globalization, and to a legitimacy crisis sparked by unresolved structural issues from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) era and tensions surfacing in GATT case law around ‘trade and’ issues. Investment law today is undergoing a similar legitimacy crisis for similar reasons, particularly with respect to Bilateral Investment Treaties and investor–State arbitration. We argue that investment law is ripe for a similar paradigm shift, away from the dominant view of investment law as a private ordering system to protect capital, with roots in contract law and commercial arbitration, and towards recognition of the fact that investment law today is part of a comprehensive global economic governance system meant to ensure justice and the rule of law in one aspect of international economic relations, the allocation of investment capital. This paradigm shift has normative, structural and doctrinal implications, which we explore, and promises to help restore legitimacy to investment law as it also improves substantive outcomes.", 06 January 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 4, December 2015, Pages 861–892, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv042
6,China’s Outward Foreign Direct Investment and International Investment Law,"['Karl P. Sauvant', ' Michael D. Nolan']","As China’s outward foreign direct investment (FDI) has grown, its approach to international investment agreements (IIAs) has changed. China is now one of the world’s most important outward investors, with Chinese FDI facing widespread criticism. The challenge for China is to adapt to this new configuration of interests stemming from these developments, both in terms of its national policies and the contents of its IIAs. In so doing, it is likely to influence, perhaps significantly, the further evolution of international investment law. This article deals briefly with the salient features of China’s outward FDI and the policies that support it (Section A); the perception and reception of China’s outward FDI in key host countries (Section B); and the changing nature of the country’s approach to international investment treaties (Section C). The article concludes (Section D) with a brief review and outlook.", 20 November 2015,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 18, Issue 4, December 2015, Pages 893–934, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgv045
