0,Trade Integration in the CIS Region: A Thorny Path Towards a Customs Union,['Sherzod Shadikhodjaev'],"One of the peculiarities of trade integration in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is that it was launched by non-WTO members. Nevertheless, their wish to integrate into the multilateral trading system induced them to incorporate WTO standards into their RTAs. Another distinctive feature is that integration in the CIS proceeds at diverse speed and different levels. CIS integration towards a customs union has taken place in three directions within the CIS economic union, the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC) and the Single Economic Space (SES), though only the EurAsEC project has remained operational. Overlapping disciplines adopted within different regional frameworks are a barrier to intense trade integration, so certain coordination is needed. The formation of a EurAsEC customs union in parallel with the WTO accession talks is very challenging. Thus it is suggested to finalize the creation of the customs union either before or after the WTO accession of all EurAsEC members.", 22 May 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 3, September 2009, Pages 555–578, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp023
1,Does the WTO Need a Permanent Body of Panelists?,"['Marc L. Busch', ' Krzysztof J. Pelc']","There is a longstanding debate over the need for a permanent body of panelists at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Put most starkly by the European Communities (EC), the argument is that only full-time jurists would have the experience needed to render ‘better and more consistent rulings’ that could stand up under appellate review. India and the African Group, among others, challenge the logic of Europe's proposal and its empirical underpinnings. Our article weighs in on this debate, offering the first statistical test of the EC's hypothesis, that conditional on being appealed, rulings handed down by less-experienced panelists are more likely to be reversed. We find that experience matters, but only with regards to the panel's chair. Indeed, on appeal, panels led by experienced chairs are far less likely to have their rulings reversed by the Appellate Body; the experience of the other panelists, by comparison, is inconsequential. The implication is that rather than constituting a permanent body of panelists, the WTO would be better served by establishing a pool of permanent chairs. As for the timeliness of panel reports, which is Europe's—and the literature's—other outcome of interest, we find no evidence that judicial experience matters in the least.", 09 June 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 3, September 2009, Pages 579–594, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp024
2,Aggressive Regionalism in Korea–U.S. FTA: The Present and Future of Korea's FTA Policy,['Won-Mog Choi'],"The Korea–US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is a result of a paradigm shift from traditional regionalism, which deals mostly with customs–border issues, to ‘aggressive regionalism’ that codifies a whole-scale problem-solving process. A series of age-old bilateral trade disputes, such as the automobile trade imbalance, unethical business practices in pharmaceuticals and medical devices and effective protection of copyrights, were actively addressed between Korea and the United States, and permanent solutions to the problems were sought in the form of stable and binding FTA rules. New global or regional issues, such as the non-implementation of WTO panel decisions and South and North Korea's economic cooperation, were also dealt with.
When negotiating future FTAs, Korea will continue to take the problem-solving approach based on this aggressive regionalism. Particular focus will be given to such sensitive issues regarding the trade remedy system, unfair business practices, sanitary and food safety and economic engagement policies towards North Korea. As Korea becomes part of more FTAs, transaction costs caused by fragmented FTAs will become an economic issue. In order to reduce the costs of the aggressive regionalism policy, Korea must adopt the advanced level of accumulation system for the rules of origin and it should endeavour to ultimately harmonize varying rules among FTAs. This strategy may start by linking to other FTAs. It is suggested that achieving such ‘multilateral regionalism’ should be a long-term task for Korea.", 23 June 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 3, September 2009, Pages 595–615, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp025
3,Trade and Equality: A Relationship to Discover,['Gillian Moon'],"There is conspicuous inequality among World Trade Organisation (WTO) member countries. WTO law has responded to this by creating a set of rules (Special and Differential Treatment or S&DT) which permit specially favorable trading treatment to support the participation of developing countries, even though equality of treatment is a central principle and objective of WTO law. Yet, it is widely agreed that S&DT has not succeeded in its aim of advancing trade equality. Insight into the reasons for this relative failure may be drawn from another body of international law which has equality as a core principle and objective and which also permits special treatment, human rights equality law. Analyzing commonly identified flaws in S&DT from the perspective of the theoretical, conceptual and strategic framework of human rights equality law enables the flaws to be understood more deeply. It also offers a new perspective on the impasse which has been reached in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and provides robust guidance as to how S&DT may be made stronger, more effective and more operational.", 03 August 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 3, September 2009, Pages 617–642, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp028
4,Reaching REACH: The Challenge for Chemicals Entering International Trade,['Doaa Abdel Motaal'],"Europe accounts for approximately 50% of the world's chemical imports, having imported over $160 billion worth of chemicals in 2007. Some of the principal chemicals exporters to Europe are the United States, Switzerland, Singapore, China, Japan and Russia. In being such a large player on the international stage, any change to Europe's chemical regulations unsurprisingly reverberates in international trade. Enacted in 2007, Europe's new REACH regulation has represented no less than full overhaul of Europe's chemicals management regime and, in doing so, has led to some consternation at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This article describes the various provisions of REACH, comparing REACH to the prevailing chemicals management regime in the world's second major importer of chemicals, the United States. It finds that REACH reverses the burden of proof and burden of work from the regulator to the manufacturer. The article then sets out the full scope of the trade concerns that WTO members have raised with respect to REACH, arguing that since pre-registration under REACH has barely ended, the jury is still out how effective this overhaul will be.", 17 July 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 3, September 2009, Pages 643–662, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp027
5,Addressing Tied Aid: Towards a More Development-Oriented WTO?,"['Annamaria La Chimia', ' Sue Arrowsmith']","‘Tied aid’ refers to aid granted by one country or countries to another on condition that the goods or services acquired are purchased from the donor(s). Despite the fact that tying aid seems contrary to the World Trade Organization's (WTO) basic principles of free trade and is an important issue for developing countries, it has received little attention from scholars or practitioners, even during the current ‘development round’ of negotiations. This article fills a gap in the literature by elaborating the way in which tied aid in relation to goods is affected by WTO rules. The analysis reveals that the WTO Agreements give little specific attention to the issue and that practices relating to tied aid are either outside the WTO rules or covered only in a limited or uncertain way such that the rules have little practical impact. Given the importance of tied aid for trade and for the WTO's development agenda, the analysis thus indicates that tied aid is an area requiring future consideration in the WTO. The analysis also serves to elucidate the complex legal architecture of the WTO Agreements as they relate to tied aid, which is important for any future efforts to address this subject.", 04 September 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 3, September 2009, Pages 707–747, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp030
6,Carbon Tariffs and the WTO: An Evaluation of Feasible Policies,['Paul-Erik Veel'],"Both the European Union, which currently has an emissions trading scheme for greenhouse gases, and the USA, which is considering implementing such a program, are exploring the possibility of including foreign producers in that program by requiring importers of foreign goods to pay charges relating to the amount of CO2 emitted in the production of those goods. This article examines the legality of such measures under WTO law. While academic literature has in recent years considered carbon tariffs in the abstract, this article contextualizes that discussion by analyzing European and American proposals to enact carbon tariffs, focusing primarily on the 2008 Lieberman-Warner Bill. This article concludes that carbon tariffs are, subject to a number of constraints, generally permissible under WTO law. However, it also argues that while carbon tariffs may generally be legally permissible, additional domestic political constraints may significantly limit the set of legal carbon tariffs which are practically feasible in any given state. This article posits that any meaningful discourse on carbon tariffs must incorporate both political and legal constraints, and it seeks to contribute to this discourse by identifying the relevant constraints and exploring certain policy options which could satisfy those constraints.", 09 September 2009,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 12, Issue 3, September 2009, Pages 749–800, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgp031
