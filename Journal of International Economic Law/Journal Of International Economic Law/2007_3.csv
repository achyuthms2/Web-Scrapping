0,Eleven Years of GATS Case Law: What Have We Learned?,['Eric H. Leroux'],"The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) negotiators faced a significant challenge when having to craft a comprehensive set of disciplines governing multilateral trade in services, and the result is somewhat complex. Some obligations, in particular the most favoured-nation treatment (MFN) obligation, apply across the board. Others, like the market access and national treatment obligations, apply only in respect of service sectors of a Member's choosing. There is overlap between the market access and national treatment obligations, and the relationship between these two disciplines and those on domestic regulation is not clearly established. Additional obligations have been adhered to on a voluntary basis, in particular in the areas of telecommunications and financial services. In general, the interpretation and understanding of Members’ Schedules of Specific Commitments proves to be a laborious exercise. This provides fertile ground for difficult and often sensitive interpretive issues to arise. Although Members have thus far not made extensive use of dispute settlement procedures to resolve them, existing World Trade Organization (WTO) decisions already show the reach of GATS disciplines and their potential impact on Members’ policies and regulations. The Gambling case has, in particular, sparked a debate as to what should be the right balance between trade constraints and the autonomy of Members’ service regulators. This article reviews the GATS case law with a view to offering a critical assessment of the main systemic issues that have been addressed by WTO adjudicatory bodies. These issues are, respectively, the scope of application of the GATS, the interpretation of specific commitments in Members’ Schedules, market access, non-discriminatory treatment, and general exceptions.", 10 July 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 4, December 2007, Pages 749–793, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm014
1,The Legal Basis for Using Principles in WTO Disputes,['Andrew D. Mitchell'],"This article argues that the use of principles in WTO dispute resolution is both necessary and desirable. However, Panels and the Appellate Body (WTO Tribunals) have often ignored principles or not clearly identified the legal basis for their use. This article establishes a framework for the use of principles (in particular principles of WTO law, principles of customary international law, and general principles of law) in WTO dispute settlement. Broadly, WTO Tribunals can use principles drawn from these categories to interpret WTO provisions, based on Article 3.2 of the DSU, and Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. This follows most directly from a teleological approach to interpretation, but principles also feature under subjective and textual approaches to interpretation. WTO Tribunals may also use certain principles in a non-interpretative manner. Indeed, this may be necessary, particularly to address procedural issues. Precisely how a principle may be used depends on its type, content and status.", 14 November 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 4, December 2007, Pages 795–835, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm037
2,No More Negotiated Deals?: Settlement of Trade and Investment Disputes in East Asia,['Junji Nakagawa'],"Many argue that East Asian countries have come to adopt ‘aggressive legalism’ in trade and investment policy, in the sense that they have come to settle their trade and investment disputes through the dispute settlement mechanism (DSM) of the WTO and the other third-party procedures. Scrutiny of the dispute cases of these countries shows, however, that East Asian legalism is not so aggressive, that it varies country by country, and that there still exists room for negotiated deals in settling trade and investment disputes among them. On the other hand, the recent move toward regional integration through free trade agreements (FTAs), economic partnership agreements (EPAs), and bilateral investment treaties (BITs) in East Asia may lead to the adoption of a more aggressive legalism in the region, in particular in settling investment disputes, disputes relating to intellectual property rights, and trade remedies.", 12 September 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 4, December 2007, Pages 837–867, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm032
3,The WTO Legality of the EU's GSP+ Arrangement,['Lorand Bartels'],"In EC—Tariff Preferences, the Appellate Body held that the WTO Enabling Clause permitted developed countries to grant better tariff treatment to some developing countries than to others, subject to certain conditions. It held further that these conditions were not met by the EU's so-called ‘drugs arrangement’, a system of additional preferences (normally duty free treatment) for certain countries which the EU had determined were in need of special tariff preferences, thanks to their involvement in combating the production and trafficking of narcotics. In response to this ruling, when the EU renewed its GSP programme in 2005, it replaced its drugs arrangement and two similar, though less generous, labour and environment arrangements with a new arrangement popularly known as the ‘GSP+ arrangement’. Under this arrangement, additional tariff preferences (normally duty free treatment), were made available to developing countries committing to ratify and implement a list of human rights and good governance conventions. According to the EU, the GSP+ arrangement complies with the Appellate Body's interpretation of the Enabling Clause. This article argues that it does not. This is primarily because of the substantive criteria chosen by the EU to select GSP+ beneficiaries, which do not meet the Appellate Body's criteria for differential tariff treatment of developing countries. Second, it is because the EU's requirement that would-be beneficiaries must have applied by a certain date, replicates the problem of the ‘closed list’ of beneficiaries that was fatal to the earlier incarnation of the EU's GSP program. The article concludes with some suggestions for designing a GSP+ arrangement more likely to meet the Appellate Body's conditions than the EU's present arrangement.", 11 October 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 4, December 2007, Pages 869–886, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm035
4,Coverage of the WTO's Agreement on Government Procurement: Challenges of Integrating China and other Countries with a Large State Sector into the Global Trading System,['Wang Ping'],"The WTO's plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) is a significant WTO instrument to develop disciplines regulating government procurement. A recent major review of the GPA has led to a revised text, likely to enter into force in 2007. In the meanwhile, China, a country with a large state sector, has promised to initiate GPA accession negotiations by the end of 2007.
The article provides a critical assessment of the extent to which the recent review of the coverage of the GPA has appreciated the characteristics of the government procurement regime of those countries with a large state sector. It is argued that the lack of a principled approach to entity coverage and the ambiguities surrounding the scope of covered procurement are likely to substantially hinder the negotiating process and prevent the optimal outcome of accession negotiations. It is suggested that a formula consisting of basic factors defining the coverage of government procurement disciplines, such as government control and competition, should be employed to address this issue.", 21 September 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 4, December 2007, Pages 887–920, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm034
5,The Doha Round's Public Health Legacy: Strategies for the Production and Diffusion of Patented Medicines under the Amended TRIPS Provisions,"['Frederick M. Abbott', ' Jerome H. Reichman']","The entry into force of the World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS Agreement in 1995 transformed the international intellectual property system. The harmonization of basic intellectual property standards has operated to protect investment in innovation, limiting risks from unjustified ‘free riding’. Yet these same harmonized IP standards sharply curtailed the traditional capacity of suppliers of public goods, such as health care and nutrition, to address priority needs of less affluent members of society, particularly in (but not limited to) developing countries. In the Doha Declaration, the Waiver Decision of 30 August 2003 and the Article 31bis Protocol of Amendment, stakeholders concerned with re-opening policy space for the supply of newer pharmaceutical products pushed back against restrictive elements of the TRIPS Agreement.
Governments around the world are in the process of deciding whether to ratify and accept the Article 31bis Amendment. Based on their Study for the International Trade Committee of the European Parliament, the authors argue that acceptance of the Amendment will provide a ‘net benefit’ for countries seeking to improve access to medicines. At the insistence of WTO delegations acting on behalf of the originator pharmaceutical industry lobby, Article 31bis regrettably is saddled with unnecessary administrative hurdles. Nonetheless, through skillful lawyering, political determination and coordinated planning, the system can be made to work. Among other options, expeditious back-to-back compulsory licensing linked with pooled procurement strategies may effectively achieve economies of scale in production and distribution of medicines.
The authors doubt that the international political environment would support renegotiation of an ‘improved’ solution. They express concern that failure to bring the Amendment into force will open the door to a campaign to undermine the Waiver Decision. Recent events in Brazil and Thailand illustrate both the opportunities and risks associated with implementing TRIPS exception mechanisms, and help to inform views on the negotiating environment. Specific proposals for regional cooperation in implementing the Amendment are laid out, and the authors emphasize the importance of pursuing concrete transfer of technology measures in support of developing country pharmaceutical manufacturing. Over-reliance on private market mechanisms for the supply of public health goods leaves the international community with an unresolved collective action problem on a large scale.", 01 December 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 4, December 2007, Pages 921–987, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm040
6,A Proposal for a Framework Convention on Global Health,['Lawrence O. Gostin'],"This article searches for solutions to the most perplexing problems in global health—problems so important that they affect the fate of millions of people, with economic, political, and security ramifications for the world's population. No State, acting alone, can insulate itself from major health hazards. It is for this reason that safeguarding the world's population requires cooperation and global governance. What is truly needed, and what richer countries instinctively do for their own citizens, is to meet what I call ‘basic survival needs.’ By focusing on the major determinants of health, the international community could dramatically improve prospects for good health. A vehicle such as a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) could powerfully improve global health governance. Such a Framework Convention would commit States to a set of targets, both economic and logistic, and dismantle barriers to constructive engagement by the private and charitable sectors. It would stimulate creative public/private partnerships and actively engage civil society stakeholders. A FCGH could set achievable goals for global health spending; define areas of cost effective investment to meet basic survival needs; build sustainable health systems; and create incentives for scientific innovation for affordable vaccines and essential medicines.", 01 December 2007,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 10, Issue 4, December 2007, Pages 989–1008, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgm039
