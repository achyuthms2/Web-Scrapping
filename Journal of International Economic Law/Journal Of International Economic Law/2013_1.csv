0,Reconsidering financial remedies in WTO dispute settlement,"['Marco Bronckers', ' Freya Baetens']","Enforcing international law remains problematic: what happens if a sovereign state refuses to comply with its obligations, even after an international adjudicatory body has ruled in its disfavour? The solution offered under the World Trade Organization (WTO) system has been to authorize the prevailing member in the settlement of a dispute to retaliate, if and when the respondent member fails to implement a panel or Appellate Body ruling. Such retaliation can take the form of additional restrictions on imports of goods or services, or suspensions of intellectual property rights. Our article examines whether fairer and more effective means of ensuring compliance could be inserted into the WTO system. First, existing remedy systems are outlined, comparing general public international law with the current WTO system. We posit that the objective of both is rule compliance and take issue with the recent theory of efficient breach. Further support is drawn from the EU compliance regime. This is followed by an examination of the advantages of introducing financial remedies in WTO dispute settlement as well as a refutation of potential objections. The main elements of the subsequent proposal relate to the calculation, term, retro-activity and beneficiary of financial payments as a remedy.", 16 May 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2013, Pages 281–311, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt014
1,Freedom of Transit and the Principles of Effective Right and Economic Cooperation: Can Systemic Interpretation of GATT Article V Promote Energy Security and the Development of an International Gas Market?,['Vitaliy Pogoretskyy'],"This article analyses the World Trade Organization (WTO) regulation of gas transit from the perspective of systemic integration of public international law. Unlike other goods, gas can be transported only via fixed infrastructure—pipelines. Consequently, in this particular context, the effective implementation of the principle of freedom of transit, incorporated into the GATT 1994, depends on the existence of certain ancillary rights, such as the right to access a transit State’s pipeline network or construct new pipelines. While these ancillary rights are not directly mentioned in the GATT, the article examines whether they can be derived from principles of general international law, subsumed under WTO law through systemic integration. The outcome of this assessment is crucial for understanding whether WTO transit rules can ensure the energy security of gas-dependent WTO Members and promote the development of an international gas market, at the period when a number of key energy-exporting and transit States have joined the WTO. The analysis of the relationship between primary and ancillary rights in the context of gas transit in this article can be transposed mutatis mutandis to other areas of network-bound trade.", 14 May 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2013, Pages 313–352, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt016
2,The ‘Missing Link’ Between the WTO and the IMF,"['Vera Thorstensen', ' Daniel Ramos', ' Carolina Muller']","This article is part of a broader study on the impacts of exchange rate on trade. It searches for an explanation on why there is no effective rule in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to neutralize the negative impacts of currency misalignments on trade instruments. In other words, it searches for the missing link between the WTO and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concerning the relationship between exchange rates and trade. It also seeks to demonstrate that, in the creation of the Bretton Woods system this link was clearly defined but was forgotten after the end of the par value. Despite all the historical and theoretical developments these two organizations have been through, their only legal link remains the same: General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) Article XV. The article analyzes the differences between the IMF Article IV approach based on the concept of manipulation of exchange rates and the GATT Article XV approach that looks for the frustration of the trade objectives. Finally, it argues for the rescue of GATT Article XV to solve the serious problem of trade rules circumvention through currency misalignments.", 14 May 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2013, Pages 353–381, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt015
3,Trade Disciplines with a Trapdoor: Contract Manufacturing,"['Rudolf Adlung', ' Weiwei Zhang']","At first glance, this article deals with a simple classification issue only: the coverage of certain manufacturing operations and the resulting products under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) rather than under its long-standing counterpart in merchandise trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yet there are important structural/conceptual differences between the two Agreements, which may have far-reaching consequences, inter alia, for the use of GATT-based tariffs and trade remedies. It is submitted that the generally applied classification system in services could prompt companies to (re-) define the ownership conditions of otherwise identical production activities, with a view to achieving cover under the GATS and thus avoiding GATT disciplines. However, the relevant criteria separating goods- from services-related operations are not only hard to specify and monitor in practice, but it is also difficult to see an underlying economic rationale. In the interest of clarity and consistency, WTO Members might thus want to close this definitional trapdoor. Due to the rapid proliferation of international production-sharing arrangements, the stakes will likely be rising.", 14 May 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2013, Pages 383–408, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt009
4,"Geographical Indications, Conflicted Preferential Agreements, and Market Access","['Crina Viju', ' May T. Yeung', ' William A. Kerr']","Canada is currently negotiating a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union; the issue of geographic indications is on the negotiating agenda and is expected to be one of the most contentious issues in the negotiations. While the exact nature of protection for Geographic Indications to be included in the agreement is not yet clear, there is potential for a conflict with commitments made by Canada in North American Free Trade Agreement. This article explores the wider issues surrounding differences in the protection of intellectual property and the effect on market access as well as the potential specific issues pertaining to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement for North American Free Trade Agreement members. General issues include, among others, how market access could be restricted either by de facto import bans or the imposition of additional costs on exporting firms; would these restrictions qualify as nullification or impairment of a benefit under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? Does the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property provides any guidance for this issue and would GIs be treated in the same way as a country entering a customs union and having to provide compensation if it raises tariffs to the common level?", 14 May 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2013, Pages 409–437, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt012
5,Intellectual Property and the EU’s Deep Trade Agenda,['Billy A. Melo Araujo'],"The EU is considered to be one of the main proponents of what has been called the deep trade agenda—that is, the push for further trade liberalization with an emphasis on the removal of domestic non-tariff regulatory measures affecting trade, as opposed to the traditional focus on the removal of trade barriers at borders. As negotiations on the Doha Development Round have stalled, the EU has attempted to achieve these aims by entering into comprehensive free trade agreements (FTAs) that are not only limited exclusively to tariffs but also extend to non-tariff barriers, including services, intellectual property rights (IPRs), competition, and investment. These FTAs place great emphasis on regulatory convergence as a means to secure greater market openings. The paper examines the EU's current external trade policy in the area of IP, particularly its attempts to promote its own regulatory model for the protection of IP rights through trade agreements. By looking at the IP enforcement provisions of such agreements, the article also examines how the divisive issues that are currently hindering the progress of negotiations at WTO level, including the demands from developing countries to maintain a degree of autonomy in the area of IP regulation as well as the need to balance IP protection with human rights protection, are being dealt with in recent EU FTAs.", 06 June 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2013, Pages 439–474, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt013
6,"Reinventing the Development Wheel of the World Trading System (Reviewing Sonia E. Rolland, Development at the World Trade Organization (2012))",['Sungjoon Cho'],"In probing how WTO norms may affect developing countries, Sonia Rolland introduces two paradigms in this book: development as an idiosyncrasy and development as a normative co-constituent to trade. The first paradigm concerns development-related exceptions and carve-outs found within WTO rules and agreements that exemplify a contingent provision of special favors to developing countries. Overall, it represents a limited mandate on development in the WTO. In contrast, the second paradigm embodies a normative operationalization of development agenda within the WTO system. It normatively reconstructs WTO rules and institutions in a way where development is a core mandate of the WTO, on par with free trade. In her reform proposals, the author reveals a subterranean advocacy of a shift from the first to second paradigm. The author offers a rare in-depth account of the past, present, and future of development in the world trading system. This Review Essay complements the author s ambitious project by locating some missing pieces of this grand puzzle of trade and development, such as general trade rules and disciplines.", 14 May 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2013, Pages 481–492, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt010
7,"Review: The Trilateral Study on Health, Intellectual Property, and Trade: The Virtue in Paving a Cleared Roadway",['Frederick M. Abbott'],"This contribution reviews an important study—‘Promoting Access to Medical Technologies and Innovation: Intersections between public health, intellectual property and trade' (the ‘Trilateral Study') jointly prepared by the Secretariats of the World Health Organization, World Intellectual Property Organization and World Trade Organization, and released in February 2013. The study is an effort to present a consolidated perspective on significant issues involving the relationship between public health, IP and trade subject matter, including how international rules addressing this subject matter may be interpreted, and how national and regional approaches may be implemented. The Trilateral Study affirms and highlights the discretion or flexibility express and inherent in the rule-system that allows governments to develop approaches suitable to the conditions within countries and regions. In this regard, the Trilateral Study is a noteworthy development in that it provides multilateral institutional support for differentiated approaches to addressing public health concerns, and this may help to alleviate or forestall external pressures being brought to bear on countries adopting such approaches.", 06 June 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2013, Pages 493–503, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt017
