0,The IMF’s Jurisdiction Over The Capital Account—Reviewing the Role of Surveillance in Managing Cross-Border Capital Flows,"['Menno Broos', ' Sebastian Grund']","The IMF’s regulatory power to exercise authority over the capital account policies of its members is based on a patchwork of restrictions and obligations. It has therefore used its soft powers in the context of bilateral and multilateral surveillance to influence its members’ policies. Indeed, the importance of capital flows and policies to manage them has long been reflected in the Fund’s surveillance mandate, from the perspective of maintaining a stable international monetary system. As this note argues, the Fund has yet to show that its soft powers will result in greater consistency of its members’ capital account policies over the longer term, or whether there is a need to increase the regulatory powers of the IMF. The Fund could also play an active role in promoting international cooperation. The G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance could possibly give guidance on the future role of the IMF in overseeing capital account policies.", 21 August 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 489–507, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy032
1,"Trade, Technology, and Transitions: Trampolines or Safety Nets for Displaced Workers?","['Michael Trebilcock', ' Sally Wong']","In the past several decades, the developed world has experienced significant labour market dislocations caused by international trade, technology, and other factors. While economic nationalism has risen in response to these challenges, technology is typically a more important factor than trade as a cause of these dislocations. Further, trade-related responses often impose additional costs on consumers through higher prices and on downstream industries that utilize inputs from protected sectors. Thus, the article argues that effective use of labour market adjustment policies (LMAPs) is a preferable approach to protectionist policies in addressing labour market adjustment costs. After laying out a spectrum of passive and active labour market policies, the article then goes on to provide a comparative evaluation of LMAPs in the USA, Canada, select Nordic and continental countries in Europe, and Australia. The article’s comparative evaluation suggests that the Nordic model, Germany, and Australia provide the most compelling utilization of LMAPs, while the USA lags behind other countries in our sample in relative resources devoted to LMAPs. However, recent trends in these jurisdictions suggest some degree of convergence on an ‘activation’ paradigm that utilizes incentive reinforcement and benefit conditionality in triggering participation in active labour market programmes.", 05 June 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 509–545, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy023
2,Income Tax and Nondiscrimination in the GATT,['Vincent Beyer'],"This article argues that the nondiscrimination obligations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) may apply to income tax measures to a larger degree than has traditionally been assumed. It has been claimed that the GATT’s focus on products largely excludes income taxes from the scope of Articles I and III. An interpretation on the basis of customary rules of interpretation as mandated by the Dispute Settlement Understanding, however, reveals that income tax measures may be subject to these obligations. To illustrate the reach of the nondiscrimination rules as set out by the GATT, the example of (im)proper transfer pricing is provided. It is reviewed how discriminatory transfer pricing measures may be subject to challenge in WTO dispute settlement proceedings. To do so, the article provides insights as to how transfer price adjustments may result in discrimination and how the standard of arm’s length may be incorporated in WTO dispute settlement. Additionally, the associated problem of transfer price documentation is analyzed. This article, thus, on the one hand advances a wide interpretation of the nondiscrimination rules and, on the other hand, illustrates their application with a topical example.", 31 July 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 547–566, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy033
3,To Be or Not to Be with Targeted Dumping,"['Kyounghwa Kim', ' Dukgeun Ahn']","The Appellate Body (AB) in US – Washing Machines clarified the concept of targeted dumping and the way to apply the pertinent part of Article 2.4.2. Above all, by limiting the applicable scope for the second sentence of Article 2.4.2 to ‘pattern transactions’ which consist of only low-priced export transactions, the Appellate Body clarifies that the remedial action for targeted dumping is dumping margins calculated by the W-T calculation methodology only for patterned exportations. Despite the AB rulings, it is still vague how to define ‘patterned export’ whose prices are significantly lower than those for other transactions. Given that the designation of targeted dumping critically hinges on the arbitrary policy of investigating authorities, such ambiguities may seriously impugn the second sentence’s feasibility in terms of its own function, i.e. unmasking ‘targeted dumping’. It remains to see whether the targeted dumping provision, especially with the AB interpretation in US – Washing Machines, can be applied as intended by drafters as well as by the WTO jurisprudence.", 07 June 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 567–598, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy014
4,Disciplining Service Sector Subsidies: Where Do We Stand and Where Can We (Realistically) Go?,"['Pierre Sauvé', ' Marta Soprana']","This article explores the (hitherto futile) quest for developing disciplines on the trade- and investment-distorting effects of services subsidies. It sheds light on the multiplicity of factors that have weighed on the conduct of negotiations on subsidy disciplines in a services trade context at both the global and preferential levels, including factor mobility, the preponderance of small- and medium-sized enterprises and the role of state-owned enterprises, and advances a few thoughts on what the future may hold for the adoption of such disciplines. The analysis suggests that World Trade Organization Members appear unlikely to reach a consensus on the matter of subsidy disciplines for services beyond those that currently (and timidly) obtain under the General Agreement on Trade in Services and in many preferential trade agreements. The main reason behind such a conclusion is the marked premium on preserving policy space in a trading environment characterized by significant and rising global market contestability.", 04 July 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 599–619, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy030
5,Renewable Energy Subsidies and WTO Law: Time to Rethink the Case for Reform Beyond Canada – Renewable Energy/Fit Program,"['Ilaria Espa', ' Gracia Marín Durán']","Since the Canada – Renewable Energy/FIT Program (2013) dispute at the World Trade Organization (WTO), it has become almost conventional wisdom in the scholarship that a clash exists between international climate change mitigation goals and WTO law, with a growing consensus (if not anxiety) that WTO subsidy rules ought to be reformed in order to safeguard ‘policy space’ for government support to renewable energy. It is contended here that, in several ways, such a call for reform has been misconceived and needs to be recalibrated. This is mainly because the case for reform has been seldom evaluated in light of State practice beyond that particular WTO dispute, nor informed by an in-depth assessment of how different clean energy subsidies will fare under existing WTO subsidy disciplines. Our aim here is to fill this gap in the existing literature. In particular, our analysis shows that the main problem is neither feed-in tariffs per se, nor the multilateral disputes that have been brought before the WTO dispute settlement bodies. For this reason, we argue that the applicability of Article XX GATT to the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), which has been often suggested in academic writings, is not the solution towards ensuring greater supportiveness between international trade and climate change regimes. In fact, such an avenue will provide no legal shelter for those climate-friendly energy subsidies that have actually been at a higher risk under current WTO rules (i.e. through unilateral remedial action). Conversely, the other common proposal of introducing a specific exemption into the SCM Agreement for certain ‘good’ renewable energy subsidies appears most effective from a mutual supportiveness perspective, but faces considerable political and practical hurdles at the present junction.", 31 July 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 621–653, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy031
6,Renegotiating International Investment Law,"['Timothy Meyer', ' Tae Jung Park']","All over the world, states are renegotiating international investment agreements at a rapid clip. Largely unnoticed, clauses in investment agreements that authorize or mandate renegotiation under specified conditions have facilitated these efforts. This article is the first to describe and analyze the variation in these renegotiation clauses. We develop a typology of renegotiation clauses in which such clauses vary along two dimensions. They range on a continuum from a full commitment to renegotiate to only a partial commitment. Renegotiation clauses can also call for full scope renegotiation or partial scope renegotiation. The literature on renegotiating international agreements has heretofore overlooked the existence and purposes of provisions requiring partial scope renegotiation. Partial scope renegotiation represents a departure from the ‘single undertaking’ model of negotiations common to international economic law. By altering both the scope of, and commitment to, renegotiation, parties can conclude agreements today while deferring resolution of difficult issues to the future. At the same time, they can also constrain the possibility of opportunism by limiting the subject matter under renegotiation. Most importantly, partial scope renegotiation offers a method to reduce the critical tension underlying the modern international economic order: the pace and degree to which non-Western style economies are required to liberalize their markets.", 02 July 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 655–679, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy029
7,Implementing Transparency and Public Participation in FTA Negotiations: Are the Times a-Changin’?,['Maria Laura Marceddu'],"Are the negotiations of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) changing? As the recent negotiations of mega-regionals display, much has changed over the last decade. While people still perceive these agreements, and the trade and investment chapters in particular, as an intrusion in a wide range of domestic policies and sovereignty sensitivities, the ‘public’ is now given the opportunity to have an actual standing in the processes underpinning the formulation of investment policies. This participation of non-state actors has been particularly facilitated by the ‘transparency campaign’ that has urged states to introduce various mechanisms to implement the transparency of FTA negotiations and gather the public inputs, thus paving the way for new direct forms of public involvement. Canada and the USA have long been familiar with this approach, which has recently been further implemented and developed in the context of not only the European Union but also outside the Western world, for example, in Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and Malaysia. Taken together, these experiences suggest that, in recent years, the negotiations of FTAs are undergoing a change to allow for more transparency and public participation but need constant refinements to be meaningfully implemented.", 19 July 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 681–702, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy034
8,Missing Investment Treaties,"['Rodrigo Polanco Lazo', ' Valentino Desilvestro', ' Azernoosh Bazrafkan']","This article presents the situation of ‘Missing Investment Treaties’ (MITs), defined as those International Investment Agreements (IIAs) that have been concluded by States, but their texts (and in some cases their existence) are not publicly available or incomplete. In order to determine the number of MITs, we examined the text and language availability of IIAs concluded by countries, that are publicly available, and we complemented that information with country-specific searches from international, governmental and private sources. In turn, the article explores possible explanations to this State's behaviour, using the following questions as guidelines: Why would countries sign agreements that are supposedly negotiated to promote, protect or liberalise foreign investment without making those texts available? If a text of an IIA is publicly available, does it correspond to the language of both contracting parties, only one of them, or of a third country? Is it possible to achieve IIAs' objectives if the text of the treaty is not available, or is it available only in one language? Might there be other reasons to sign these agreements?", 25 May 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 3, September 2018, Pages 703–731, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy013
