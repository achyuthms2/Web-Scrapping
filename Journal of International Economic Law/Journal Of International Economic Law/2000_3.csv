0,'Should' means 'shall': a critical analysis of the obligation to submit information under article 13.1 of the DSU in the Canada - Aircraft case,['R Behboodi'],"In the case Canada - Measures Affecting the Export of Civilian Aircraft, the Appellate Body found that disputing parties had a legal obligation to submit information and documents requested of them by panels. The Appellate Body based this finding on the third sentence of Article 13.1 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU). The Appellate Body further found that panels have a right to draw adverse inferences when requests for the production of documents and information are not heeded. This finding was based on the procedure set out in Annex V of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), even though Annex V is expressly restricted to proceedings under Article 7 of the SCM Agreement. This article describes and analyses the findings of the Appellate Body. It argues that they are consistent with neither the text of the DSU nor the intentions of the drafters. Moreover, the Appellate Body's analysis of the 'duty' of disputing parties to submit information and documents to arbitral tribunals, and the right of such tribunals to draw adverse inferences, is far broader than those provided in public international law. The article concludes with some institutional and systemic concerns triggered by the new case law.", 01 December 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 4, December 2000, Pages 563–592, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.4.563
1,Preconditions for private restraints on market access and international cartels,"['SJ Evenett', ' VY Suslow']","With the decline of government-imposed trade barriers policymakers have given greater attention to the international distortions created by the practices of private firms, including cartels. We critically evaluate the techniques used in the economic literature to estimate the effects of these private practices, finding them wanting on several grounds. In contrast, many of the necessary conditions for these practices to distort resource allocation are observable, which leads us to propose filters that policymakers can employ when evaluating accusations of impaired access to foreign markets or cartelization. Before undertaking an evaluation of the effects of a foreign private practice, policymakers would check whether the necessary conditions are in place for that practice to successfully distort market outcomes. Failure to pass this initial filter would lead to the accusation being dismissed. We discuss how this filter can be operationalized, drawing extensively upon published sources and empirical studies.", 01 December 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 4, December 2000, Pages 593–631, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.4.593
2,The World Bank and climate change,['W-c Shih'],"The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is inextricably linked with economic and development policies. This raises the question, to what extent do the commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions under the Climate Change Convention affect the practices and policies of the World Bank? After briefly describing the interaction between climate change and economic development, as well as the respective instruments of the Climate Change Treaty and the World Bank, this paper identifies several windows through which the obligations set out by the Climate Change Treaty affect the World Bank. These include the Global Environmental Facility, the Operational Policies adopted by the Executive Directors of the World Bank, specific loan structures and conditions as well as the recent Prototype Carbon Fund.", 01 December 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 4, December 2000, Pages 633–653, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.4.633
3,China's WTO accession: commitments and implications,['Q Kong'],"One hundred years after its adoption, China's Open Door policy is bearing fruit: China has concluded expansive market access agreements with its major trading partners that have paved the way for its becoming a Member of the World Trading Community. As a necessary cost of the WTO accession, China has made remarkable commitments, particularly in relation to its current trade practice. These commitments raise the question of whether China will be able to surpass the formidable barriers of implementation in order to become an honourable Member of the World Trading Community. In an effort to provide some answers in this regard, this article examines the process of China's WTO accession process, and the positive links between China's internal reform and its external economic integration. The focus of the analysis is on measuring the gap between China's commitments for WTO membership and its current practice. The article further assesses the factors that affect the implementation of China's commitments, i.e. its law concerning international agreements, the inherent domestic constraints, and the outside monitoring. The analysis allows the tentative conclusion that the internal drive for openness evidenced in recent practice, and the outside monitoring assisted with persuasion will outweigh the negative historical context.", 01 December 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 4, December 2000, Pages 655–690, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.4.655
4,Amicus curiae submissions in the Carbon Steel case: another rabbit from the appellate body's hat?,['AE Appleton'],"In the Carbon Steel decision, the Appellate Body finally explains its legal authority to accept amicus curiae submissions. From a legal perspective this explanation is neither entirely satisfactory nor convincing, raising questions concerning the manner in which the Appellate Body exercises the authority vested in it by the Members. Despite possible misgivings among the Members, because of the automaticity principle, amicus curiae submissions are here to stay. There is therefore a need to establish rules and a timetable governing the Appellate Body's treatment of such submissions.", 01 December 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 4, December 2000, Pages 691–699, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.4.691
5,'Multifunctionality' and 'non-trade concerns' in the agriculture negotiations,['F Smith'],"In March 2000 talks recommenced on the renegotiation of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture after the failure of the Seattle Ministerial Meeting in December 1999. International agricultural trade regulation has always been challenging for both the GATT and the WTO and it is likely that it will remain difficult in the renegotiation discussions. The root of the problem this time is whether 'non-trade concerns' should be included into the amended agreement. In essence, Members are being asked to consider if agricultural support measures can be retained where they also have positive effects in other sectors. This note highlights the problems of incorporating 'non-trade concerns', whilst preventing it becoming yet another smokescreen for agricultural protectionism. The note highlights three difficulties. Firstly, whether there is a difference between the terms 'multifunctionality' and 'non-trade concerns'. Secondly, which issues could be 'non-trade trade concerns' for the purposes of the amended agreement, and thirdly, the difficulties relating to the implementation method.", 01 December 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 4, December 2000, Pages 707–713, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.4.707
