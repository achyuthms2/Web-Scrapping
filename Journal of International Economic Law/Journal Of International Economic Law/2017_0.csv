0,"Trade, Social Preferences and Regulatory Cooperation The New WTO-Think","['Thomas J. Bollyky', ' Petros C. Mavroidis']","This article advocates changes in the corporate governance of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reflect the decline in tariffs and other border restraints to commerce and the emerging challenges of advancing freer trade and better regulation cooperation in a world economy dominated by global value chains. Together, these changes form an integration strategy that we refer to as the new WTO Think. This strategy remains rooted in the original rationale of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) of reducing the negative externalities of unilateral action and solving important international coordination challenges, but is more inclusive of regulators and non-state actors and more flexible and positive in its means. In particular, we advocate that the WTO should embrace the confluence of shared social preferences and trade, where it exists, as a motivation for advancing international regulatory cooperation. The WTO should also multilateralize the important regulatory cooperation occurring in smaller clubs of like-minded countries and better facilitate the use of plurilateral agreements where consensus across all WTO members is not yet possible.", 27 February 2017,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 1, March 2017, Pages 1–30, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw076
1,The Role of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement In the Internet Ecosystem: Uneasy Liaison or Synergistic Alliance?,['Neha Mishra'],"The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is the first trade agreement that comprehensively deals with contemporary policy issues in digital trade. It introduces new disciplines on issues such as cross-border data flows, online privacy, network neutrality, cybersecurity, regulation of spam, and safe harbour protection for internet intermediaries. These provisions are atypical of trade agreements, and are particularly significant as they have a direct impact on internet policy. In this article, I evaluate these new disciplines in the TPP to assess the extent to which the TPP is suitably placed in the internet eco-system. After a comprehensive legal assessment of these disciplines, I argue that the TPP does not effectively fit into the broader internet ecosystem, as it fails to synergize the goal of trade liberalization with important internet policy concerns such as facilitating trust of internet users and digital innovation. However, despite its deficiencies, the TPP sets a new benchmark for rules on digital trade, as its provisions address several contemporary issues in the digital economy. Therefore, the provisions on digital trade within the TPP will be instrumental in future negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other regional bodies. More importantly, the TPP is a reminder of the increasing significance of trade agreements in influencing critical aspects of internet policy. Particularly, in developing rules on digital trade that affect issues such as cross-border data flows, online privacy and consumer protection, net neutrality and cybersecurity, trade negotiators/lawyers need to comprehensively assess the relevance of these rules in the liberalization of digital trade, and its broader impact on the internet ecosystem.", 08 February 2017,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 1, March 2017, Pages 31–60, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw080
2,Promoting Coherence Between PTAs and the WTO Through Systemic Integration,"['Pamela Apaza Lanyi', ' Armin Steinbach']","The proliferation of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) has resulted in a heterogeneous regime of trade rules applicable among WTO Members. The interplay between PTA and WTO rules has several implications, including risks of legal tensions and incoherence between both regimes, as well as between overlapping networks of PTAs. Consequently, adjudicative bodies both under regional PTAs and global WTO dispute settlement mechanisms are increasingly confronted with taking account of alien legal sources for the purpose of interpretation. Coherence between PTA and WTO rules thus depends on the degree to which adjudication at both levels—PTA and WTO—allows integration of alien legal sources. This article explores the role of systemic integration as a method of interpretation under public international law allowing adjudicating bodies to deal with possible tensions and promote coherence within international trade law. It traces the various approaches to systemic integration pertaining to international trade rules as employed under both WTO and PTA adjudication. While systemic integration offers a public international law tool for reducing fragmentation of substantial law, there is heterogeneity in adjudicative practice regarding the readiness to employ systemic integration for the purpose of interpretation. The article identifies possible avenues through which future dispute settlement can exploit the potential for coherence through systemic integration, as well as elements which could be taken into consideration when integrating multilateral and preferential rules. It also provides insight on how PTAs could facilitate the application of systemic integration by adjudicating bodies at both levels.", 02 March 2017,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 1, March 2017, Pages 61–85, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw078
3,Punctuated Equilibrium: The Potential Role of FTA Trade Commissions in the Evolution of International Investment Law,['Amokura Kawharu'],"This article considers whether commissions of the State parties created under free trade agreements (FTAs) may provide a framework for States to take more responsibility for decision-making within the international investment regime. One of the central features of the current regime, built primarily on the basis of bilateral investment treaties, is the lack of provision for institutionalized decision-making by States. Rather, most decision-making is carried out through ad hoc investor–State dispute settlement. This lack of involvement by States after treaties have been signed weakens the ability of the regime to respond to the many challenges it currently faces. At the same time, the promotion and use of trade commissions raises several questions, relating, inter alia, to their accountability, potential for conflict with judicial roles, and more widely, their place within an increasingly complex international legal system. Trade commissions have the potential to make a useful contribution to the governance of the investment regime but in assuming greater decision-making responsibility, States will also need to ensure that their trade commissions’ act responsibly too.", 17 February 2017,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 1, March 2017, Pages 87–113, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw077
4,The Right to Restructure Sovereign Debt,['Vassilis Paliouras'],"This article attempts to delineate the scope of a state right to restructure sovereign debt. It begins by tracing the origin of such a right to state sovereignty and then evaluates the limitations imposed upon it through participation in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Beyond analyzing the legal position with respect to a state right to restructure sovereign debt, the article stresses the potential tensions between the IMF’s policies relating to sovereign debt restructuring and a normative concept of sovereignty. The article concludes by presenting reform proposals able to alleviate these tensions.", 01 March 2017,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 1, March 2017, Pages 115–136, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgx005
5,Chinese Multilateralism in the AIIB,['Bin Gu'],"The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB, or the Bank) marks the first endeavor of Asian developing countries as initiators, with China at the center, in multilateral development financing. The glamour of the AIIB lies in multilateralism—the underlying principle based on which it is institutionalized. Chinese multilateralism for the AIIB is different from American multilateralism, which is embedded in the Bretton Woods institutions and has enabled the USA as a hegemon to strengthen its leadership in the world economy. China is not a hegemon; and most importantly, it has no will to counter the existing world order through the establishment of the AIIB. Rather, the Bank has positioned itself in a complementary role in international development financing. Meanwhile, Chinese multilateralism aims to improve global governance, tilting toward balance in favor of those underrepresented. The AIIB meets both the needs of China’s domestic reforms, and the world’s expectation of a responsible stakeholder and contributor. It fulfills multilateralism in both its constitutional charter and standards.", 16 March 2017,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 20, Issue 1, March 2017, Pages 137–158, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgx006
