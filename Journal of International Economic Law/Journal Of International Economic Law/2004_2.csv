0,STANDARD OF REVIEW IN WTO LAW,"['Claus-Dieter Ehlermann', ' Nicolas Lockhart']","There is no escaping standard of review in WTO dispute settlement. While the contested national measure and the claims made change from case to case, standard of review is a constant feature. In every case, panels and the Appellate Body must decide how intensively a measure should be reviewed and how much deference should be granted to national decision makers. Standard of review, therefore, plays a central role in defining the powers of national authorities in the trade field. In recent years, perhaps the most frequent criticism made of panels and the Appellate Body is that they have been overly intrusive in their review of national measures. This article explores the role and operation of standard of review in WTO law. It begins with the basic requirement that panels must make an ‘objective assessment of the matter’ and argues that this requirement does not specify the precise nature or intensity of review that panels undertake. The article goes on to consider how panels and the Appellate Body have approached the review of legal and factual determinations, as well as of different types of national measure. In particular, the article examines the review of trade remedy measures, SPS and TBT measures, and measures covered by the GATT 1994. The case-law indicates that the character of review changes with the nature of the determination at issue and also with the obligations in the covered agreement in consideration. The article suggests that the differing approaches to review reflect differences in the covered agreements themselves regarding the respective roles of panels and national authorities.", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 491–521, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.491
1,THE PERSISTENT PUZZLES OF SAFEGUARDS: LESSONS FROM THE STEEL DISPUTE,['Alan O. Sykes'],"The recent WTO dispute between the United States and eight complainant nations over protective measures for the steel industry brought widespread attention to a little known area of WTO law – the rules governing ‘safeguard measures’, the temporary protection of troubled industries against import surges. The use of safeguard measures is normatively controversial, although their welfare implications are much less clear than their critics sometimes suggest. This paper makes the point that WTO rules, as interpreted by recent Appellate Body decisions and applied by the dispute panel in the steel case, pose nearly insurmountable hurdles to the legal use of safeguard measures by WTO members. Among other things, the current interpretation of the ‘nonattribution’ requirement for the use of safeguard measures in the WTO Safeguards Agreement obliges members to make a demonstration that is logically impossible as an economic matter. Those who believe that safeguard measures are merely wasteful protectionism may welcome such impediments to their use, but it is not obvious that the trading system will benefit in the long run, and there can be little doubt that one key objective of the Uruguay Round negotiators – to revive the use of disciplined, temporary safeguard actions – is being frustrated.", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 523–564, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.523
2,FOOD SECURITY: FOOD TRADE REGIME AND FOOD AID REGIME,['Ruosi Zhang'],"This article examines the implications of the linkage between two international regimes for food security. The WTO food trade regime influences Members' trade policies affecting food-related entitlements and may thus have an impact on food security, while the changing trade environment has undermined the traditional role of the world food aid regime in food security. Many developing countries, especially least developed and net food-importing countries may face more food difficulties than before, at least in the short term. It appears that different international regimes could produce incoherent effects on food security, even if they neither contain conflicting rules nor impose competing obligations on member States. The major reason for this situation maybe lies in the fact that food security is a complex issue involved with various factors and that a certain international regime designed to achieve a specific objective sometimes does not take into account all of these factors. Therefore, institutional cooperation and coordination are needed to redress adverse effects that may result from incoherence between international regimes.", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 565–584, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.565
3,CHALLENGES TO THE LEGITIMACY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE WORLD TRADING SYSTEM: DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND COMPETITION CULTURE IN THE WTO: INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY,['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"In June 2003, the annual conference on Preparing the Doha Development Round – WTO Negotiators Meet Academics was held at the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies of the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence and discussed Challenges to the Legitimacy and Efficiency of the World Trading System – Democratic Governance and Competition Culture in the WTO. As in the 2002 conference, academic experts presented reports on subjects related to the Doha Development Round negotiations, and WTO negotiators commented on these reports, leading to stimulating discussions among WTO ambassadors, other practitioners from developed and less-developed WTO member countries, economists, political scientists, and legal academics. This short conference report, written by the workshop organizer, summarizes the main arguments made during the discussions, without disclosing the identity of WTO negotiators since their statements presented their personal views and not necessarily their government’s official position. The summary is followed by six conference papers, and by four written comments, that served as a basis for the discussions.", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 585–603, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.585
4,THE ‘HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH’ ADVOCATED BY THE UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND BY THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION: IS IT RELEVANT FOR WTO LAW AND POLICY?,['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"The today universal recognition of ‘inalienable’ human rights implies that the legitimacy and legality of all government measures, including rules and decisions of intergovernmental organizations, depend also on their respect for human rights as defined in national constitutions and international law. This contribution argues that the universal human rights obligations of every Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) pursue objectives (like protection of personal autonomy, freedom of choice, legal security) that complement those of liberal trade and may be legally relevant context for the interpretation of WTO rules (chapters I-II). The human rights approach to international trade advocated by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (chapter III) could, like the 1996 WTO and 1998 ILO Declarations on core labor standards (chapter IV), promote synergies between human rights law and GATT/WTO law. The ‘basic rights approach’ to trade liberalization in European integration (chapter V), as well as the GATT-, WTO- and EC dispute settlement jurisprudence (chapter VI) confirm that, on the level of principles, human rights and liberal trade rules do not conflict with each other. The emerging ‘human right to democratic governance’ requires, however, more effective parliamentary involvement, citizen participation, and ‘deliberative democracy’ in WTO matters (chapter VII). A WTO Declaration (1) confirming the commitment of WTO Members to respect their existing human rights obligations in all policy areas; (2) supporting the progressive development of human rights through the competent UN and other human rights bodies; and (3) welcoming the UN initiatives for harnessing the complementarity of WTO rules and human rights for welfare-increasing cooperation among free citizens, could enhance the ‘input-legitimacy’ as well as the ‘output-legitimacy’of WTO negotiations – without creating new WTO obligations or new WTO competencies. The limited mandate of the WTO, however, and the divergent human rights concepts and diverse constitutional traditions in WTO member countries, make a consensus among WTO Members on such a Declaration unlikely. Even though the WTO should leave the interpretation, monitoring, and progressive development of human rights to specialized human rights bodies outside the WTO, WTO dispute settlement bodies may be legally required to address arguments that human rights may be relevant legal context for interpreting WTO rules (chapter VIII).", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 605–627, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.605
5,"PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT OF WTO RULE-MAKING: THE POLITICAL, NORMATIVE, AND PRACTICAL CONTEXTS",['Gregory Shaffer'],"This article addresses the issue of parliamentary oversight of WTO rule-making at the national and international levels. Parliamentarians’ views of alternative mechanisms for ensuring parliamentary control of the WTO tend to vary by jurisdiction. From a positive perspective, these views reflect power structures at the national, regional, and international levels, as well as parliamentarians’ experiences with supranational governance institutions. European political representatives are more accustomed to shared supranational governance institutions. They tend to propose expansion and adaptation of the EU model to address global governance challenges. US congressional representatives, in contrast, tend to be wary of how US ‘sovereignty’ and US power can be constrained through the WTO or any other global governance regime. They tend to oppose adding a parliamentary dimension. From a normative perspective, in order to meaningfully discuss WTO accountability we need a conceptual framework that permits us to assess the tradeoffs between different mechanisms for ensuring oversight, including parliamentary oversight, of the WTO. This article adopts a comparative institutional one. The article addresses the policy arguments for and against the addition of such a parliamentary dimension to the WTO and examines some of the many institutional challenges that would arise. The article maintains that the creation of a WTO parliamentary body should be judged in terms of its impact on the participation of less powerful stakeholders and, in particular of developing countries and their constituents, relative to other institutional alternatives.", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 629–654, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.629
6,THE WTO AND COSMOPOLITICS,['Steve Charnovitz'],"The relationship of the WTO to the international community and to its individual denizens continues to be a contentious topic in trade law and policy. In 2001, European Commissioner for Trade Pascal Lamy suggested the need for ‘cosmopolitics’ in global governance in order to improve decision-making and enhance legitimacy. In this article, Steve Charnovitz shows how the WTO already engages in various practices of cosmopolitics, despite the continuing pull of the mantra that only Members are of relevance within the WTO. Following this review of current practice, the article points several additional ways in which the WTO could boost transparency and deepen public participation.", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 675–682, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.675
7,ARE THE COMPETITION RULES IN THE WTO TRIPS AGREEMENT ADEQUATE?,['Frederick M. Abbott'],"In connection with the run-up to the Cancun Ministerial Conference, the author was asked whether there are grounds for recommending amendment of WTO TRIPS Agreement rules addressing competition. The general conclusion of the study is that the TRIPS Agreement in its present form provides substantial discretion to WTO Members in the formulation and application of competition rules regulating intellectual property, and this arrangement serves the best interests of developed and developing countries. Potential amendments were considered across a matrix of interested country groups: North-North, North-South, South-North and South-South. Although country groups with different interests might seek to modify TRIPS competition-related rules to their perceived advantage, there is little reason to believe that consensus would be reached on such changes. The study acknowledges that global welfare benefits might flow from a more highly integrated international competition regime with powers to investigate and enforce agreed upon rules. There is, however, little identifiable near-term impetus for building such a regime, whether at the WTO or elsewhere. Competition laws of certain developed countries expressly exempt conduct with wholly foreign effects from the application of rules regulating anticompetitive practices, including those concerning intellectual property. Such exemptions appear inconsistent with advocacy of liberal market principles, and they are damaging to developing country interests. As part of the Doha Development Round commitment to developing countries, a decision by developed countries to eliminate these exemptions would be constructive.", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 687–703, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.687
8,IMPROVING THE CAPACITY OF WTO INSTITUTIONS TO FULFIL THEIR MANDATE,"['Richard Blackhurst', ' David Hartridge']","The first part of the paper briefly reviews the increasingly serious shortcomings of the WTO’s ‘Green room process’, and then proceeds to develop the case for creating a formal ‘WTO Consultative Board’. As with green room meetings, a WTO Consultative Board would not be empowered to take decisions that bind the general membership. It would consult, discuss, debate, and negotiate, but its output would be limited to recommendations put forward to the entire membership for approval/acceptance. The second part of the paper deals mainly with practicalities and previous experience. There is a long history of tension between formal and informal processes of consultation and negotiation in the GATT and the WTO, which throws useful light on the issues raised in the first part. That history is presented with reference to the Green Room and the Consultative Group of Eighteen.", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 705–716, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.705
9,IS THERE A NEED FOR RESTRUCTURING THE COLLABORATION AMONG THE WTO AND UN AGENCIES SO AS TO HARNESS THEIR COMPLEMENTARITIES?,['Gary P. Sampson'],"Given the broad objectives of the WTO, it is not surprising that there is need for effective collaboration with a number of UN agencies. One specific example relates to sustainable development. At the launching of the WTO Doha Development Agenda in Qatar in November 2001, the trade ministers strongly reaffirmed their ‘commitment to the objective of sustainable development . . .’. At the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2002 in Johannesburg, ministers committed themselves to continue ‘to promote open, equitable, rules-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading . . .’. Notwithstanding such declarations, it is argued that there is scope for a clearer appreciation of the relationship between the work of the WTO and the United Nations Agencies. To achieve this, however, what is important is to identify the specific areas where there are complementarities and overlaps in their work. A selection of such areas are presented by way of example. They include the WTO Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement and its relationship to the Convention on Biological Diversity, and recent dispute settlement cases at the WTO dealing with the environment and public health. The relationship between WTO rules and those of Multilateral Environment Agreements is also reviewed, and attention is also drawn to human rights and labour standards where the everyday work of the WTO impacts on matters dealt with by United Nations Agencies. What emerges from this review is that an increasing number of non-traditional (in trade terms) issues are gravitating towards the WTO. Against this backdrop, a strong argument can be made that a trade policy organization such as the WTO should not be responsible for the non-trade issues that are gravitating towards it. One way to address this situation would be to strengthen those UN Agencies with the mandate and expertise to deal with the elements of sustainable development – economic development, the environment, and social matters. It seems, however, that the requisite political will is not forthcoming to pursue this root. Against this backdrop, two proposals are advanced as to how to proceed in the WTO.", 01 September 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 3, September 2004, Pages 717–727, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.3.717
