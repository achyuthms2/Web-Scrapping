0,The Global Pact for the Environment: Freshwater and Economic Law Synergies,['Brian McGarry'],"The Global Pact for the Environment has been proposed as an overarching framework for international environmental law, which would solidify and advance this regime in light of pressing challenges and the demands of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. By codifying principles in legally binding form, the Global Pact has attracted high expectations that it can bridge normative gaps in international environmental law and environment-related instruments, such as trade and investment agreements. The present article scrutinizes this prospect by treating the management of freshwater as a case study for the Global Pact’s potential success. The article first identifies key interplays between sources of international water law and rules governing international economic law. It then indicates how the Global Pact might effectively minimize or resolve lacunae in the convergence of these regimes without undermining existing instruments and frameworks. The author concludes that the proposed form of the Global Pact is a promising means to clarify normative interactions between freshwater management and international trade and investment, while accelerating and broadening the implementation of environmental principles within these domains.", 28 November 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 4, December 2018, Pages 745–767, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy040
1,International Data Flows and Privacy: The Conflict and Its Resolution,"['Aaditya Mattoo', ' Joshua P Meltzer']","The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) widens the scope and strengthens the enforcement of privacy standards. To protect privacy abroad, personal data is allowed out of the EU under strict conditions: if a non-EU country enacts privacy legislation equivalent to the GDPR, or if firms accept Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) or use Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) for specific business deals. These conditions pose a challenge, particularly for developing countries. A GDPR-based national privacy law would impose the same high standard on all firms, even when they sell at home, leading to higher economy-wide costs of doing business. BCRs and SCCs have proved to be costly and time-consuming. While the GDPR may raise WTO issues, litigation cannot address the central challenge: preserving opportunities for digital trade while respecting countries’ chosen levels of privacy protection. An alternative approach would involve negotiating agreements under which data destination countries protect the privacy of foreign citizens in return for source countries committing not to restrict data flows, as in the EU–US Privacy Shield and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). In parallel, and as a step toward multilateralizing these agreements, countries would develop common privacy principles, building upon the work in the OECD and APEC.", 03 December 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 4, December 2018, Pages 769–789, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy044
2,Evolutive Interpretation by the WTO Adjudicator,['Gabrielle Marceau'],"Several types of changes can take place between the conclusion of a treaty and when its provisions call for interpretation, e.g. changes in the political, social, historical or legal context; technological changes; linguistic changes; or changes in the law. Traditionally, interpreters refused to consider changes that may have occurred since the treaty’s conclusion. Today, many argue that it is more legitimate for a treaty interpreter to take account of these changes and use an ‘evolutionary’ or ‘dynamic’ interpretation. The issue of changes is particularly relevant in the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Treaty, because it combines long-standing provisions with more recent ones, and because international trade has evolved greatly, notably with electronic trade (e-commerce) and new means of distribution that did not exist when the WTO was concluded. The different types of changes discussed in this article may be grouped into four non-mutually exclusive types of situations, which will be examined through the prism of the interpretation process set out in Articles 31-33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). While different types of evolutionary interpretations can be considered under standard rules of interpretation in public international law, the use of the term ‘evolutionary interpretation’ allows for a more global understanding of the phenomenon, and might have, at the very least, a symbolic value.", 29 November 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 4, December 2018, Pages 791–813, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy042
3,A Closer Look At WTO’s Third Pillar: How WTO Committees Influence Regional Trade Agreements,"['Devin McDaniels', ' Ana Cristina Molina', ' Erik N Wijkström']","This paper illustrates how the work of World Trade Organization’s (WTO) standing bodies—its ‘Third Pillar’, as we will call it—is inspiring parties in regional trade agreements (RTA) negotiations and contributing to deeper integration. We focus on the work of the WTO technical barriers to trade (TBT) Committee and explore, as a case study, the extent to which the Committee's decision on principles for development of international standards (the Six Principles) has shaped provisions in RTAs. This Decision, arguably the most important decision taken by the TBT Committee, is meant to clarify which international standards may be a relevant basis for TBT measures; an issue that has been left undefined under the WTO TBT Agreement. Our analysis covers 260 RTAs, and shows that one quarter of RTAs has sharpened and hardened the Committee’s decision by making it directly applicable to Parties (in RTAs) whereas under the WTO they are ‘merely’ recommendations. A small number of RTAs follow a different approach and explicitly name the sources of relevant international standards.", 03 October 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 4, December 2018, Pages 815–843, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy038
4,The Obligation of Regulatory Stability in the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: How Far Have We Come?,['Federico Ortino'],"While ‘regulatory stability’ regularly features in the decisions of investment arbitral tribunals interpreting the fair and equitable treatment (FET) provision, the extent to which the FET standard disciplines ‘adverse regulatory change’ in the absence of an express stabilization commitment from the host State is far from clear. Based on the conceptual distinction between the requirement of ‘strict’ v ‘soft’ regulatory stability, the paper aims to show the way investment treaty tribunals have applied the FET provision in cases of host States’ regulatory change. The paper argues that, despite the fact that investment tribunals have increasingly recognized the need to find a better balance between protecting foreign investors from adverse regulatory changes and the right of host States to regulate in the public interest, several recent arbitral tribunals still fail to clearly set out the role of regulatory stability within the FET standard, thus failing to assuage the fears that investment treaties may indeed function as imposing excessive restraints on host States' right to regulate.", 18 October 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 4, December 2018, Pages 845–865, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy039
5,"A Theoretical Reflection on the OECD’s New Statistics Reporting Framework for the Mutual Agreement Procedure: Isolating, Measuring, and Monitoring","['Qiang Cai', ' Pengfei Zhang']","In October 2015, the G20 Finance Ministers endorsed the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project, which has been acclaimed as the most fundamental transformation of the international tax rules in almost a century. The BEPS project contains 15 actions, of which Action 14 aims to strengthen the mechanisms of international tax dispute resolution, particularly the mutual agreement procedure (MAP). This article provides a theoretical reflection on a key initiative of Action 14—the new MAP Statistics Reporting Framework (vis-à-vis the 2007 MAP Statistics Reporting Framework). While scholarly attention to this initiative is scant, this article explores its theoretical and practical implications. Specifically, the logic underlying this framework is to structure the MAP process so that the contribution of an individual competent authority could be segregated and measured and that the agency problem characterizing the MAP process could be mitigated. Based on this logic, several prospects of improving the current mechanism of MAP have been envisaged. First of all, it is proposed that the MAP process could be further structured so that the performance of the competent authorities could be better measured. Second, a more structured MAP process lends itself to more comprehensive domestic judicial review. In a broader sense, this article could also be regarded as a response to a methodological gap in the past studies of international tax dispute resolution—the shortage of theoretical reflection in this area.", 27 November 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 4, December 2018, Pages 867–884, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy043
6,"Non-Market Economies, Significant Market Distortions, and the 2017 EU Anti-Dumping Amendment",['Sherzod Shadikhodjaev'],"Anti-dumping is a fair trade mechanism of protecting domestic industries from certain underpriced imports. In December 2017, the European Union made a remarkable amendment to its anti-dumping legislation to shift from a long-standing practice of specific dumping calculations for a pre-defined list of non-market economies to a ‘country-neutral’ approach of targeting significant market distortions. The new methodology requires the European Commission to use only prices and costs not influenced by substantial government interventions and to take account of some social and environmental dimensions in the anti-dumping process. Although the new methodology formally differs from the previous one, it is largely the same in addressing severe price distortions and being capable of inflating anti-dumping duties for affected products. In this article, we discuss major changes introduced by the 2017 amendment. While we agree with the earlier scholarly conclusions that the 2017 amendment is likely to fail to meet the World Trade Organization’s legal standards, we nevertheless justify the embedded anti-distortion policy as a reasonable way of making trade fairer and suggest taking proactive actions at the global level to render the new dumping methodology internationally acceptable.", 22 November 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 4, December 2018, Pages 885–905, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy041
