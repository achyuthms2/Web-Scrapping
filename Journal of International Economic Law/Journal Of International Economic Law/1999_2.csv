0,"International cooperation in competition law and policy: what can be achieved at the bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels",['AD Melamed'],"The global economy has led to a rapid increase in the number of transnational antitrust problems, which arise when preventing or redressing competitive injury in one country requires dealing with conduct, witnesses or evidence in other countries. That, in turn, has made it increasingly important for national antitrust authorities to cooperate with one another. Cooperation can involve the sharing of knowledge about competition matters in general, as well as collaboration on specific antitrust cases, and could over time promote a common understanding on substantive antitrust principles. The United States has for many years provided technical assistance and cooperated on specific cases both formally and informally pursuant to bilateral arrangements with its counterparts in other countries and has participated in a variety of both regional and multinational fora dealing with competition issues.", 01 September 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1999, Pages 423–433, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.3.423
1,A long and winding road: trips and the evolution of an international competition framework,['PM Smith'],"This article is based on a contribution prepared for the WTO Symposium on Competition Policy and the Multilateral Trading System on the significance of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) as a starting point for negotiations for a possible international competition framework within the WTO. This article includes the parts of the author's speech focusing on similarities between the TRIPS Agreement and issues arising under the discussions in the WTO concerning competition policy. Considering the fact that in both cases the action of private parties is the subject of regulation, the idea of drawing a parallel between certain principles of TRIPS and a possible framework agreement on competition seems particularly interesting.", 01 September 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1999, Pages 435–440, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.3.435
2,The work of the international competition policy advisory committee to the attorney general and the assistant attorney general for antitrust,['ME Janow'],"This article is a brief summary of the activities and issues under consideration by the International Competition Policy Advisory Committee (ICPAC) to the Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, US Department of Justice. It describes the outreach efforts to date of the ICPAC and the analytical issues being reviewed by ICPAC members with respect to multijurisdictional mergers, trade and competition policy interface issues and enforcement cooperation between US and foreign authorities.", 01 September 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1999, Pages 441–444, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.3.441
3,Competition policy for global markers,['DK Tarullo'],"Proposals for international action on competition policy respond to four problems: increasing transnational anti-competitive activity outside control of any single nation, enforcement conflicts, market access problems, and unnecessary costs of compliance with multiple national regimes. All four are real, but limited, problems, though transnational anti-competitive activity could be very significant in the future. A competition code in the WTO would process competition problems principally as market access problems. The resulting arrangement would address market access issues imperfectly, and the other three problems not at all. International initiatives in this area must facilitate cooperation among competition authorities. The best approach is to pursue a mix of bilateral, OECD, and WTO initiatives which places protection of consumers from anti-competitive activities at the center of international efforts.", 01 September 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1999, Pages 445–455, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.3.445
4,Shrimp/turtle: untangling the nets,['AE Appleton'],"The Appellate Body's decision in the Shrimp/Turtle case has important political, systemic and procedural implications for the WTO and its dispute settlement system. From a political perspective this decision satisfies a public relations objective - reducing the distrust of the WTO which exists in the environmental community. This task is accomplished without seriously compromising the trade rights guaranteed under the WTO Agreement. From the systemic and procedural perspective, this decision clarifies certain points concerning the legal requirements of a notice of appeal and the right of non-members to make submissions to panels. However, the decision also raises questions concerning the scope of the Appellate Body's review powers, the manner in which GATT Article XX(g) and chapeau should be interpreted, the authority of the Appellate Body to consider non-member submissions, and possible inadequacies in the Dispute Settlement Understanding.", 01 September 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1999, Pages 477–496, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.3.477
5,United States law and China's WTO accession process,"['SA Rhodes', ' JH Jackson']","This article surveys the history and background of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) accession to the GATT and the WTO, and analyzes US domestic laws affecting the PRC's accession to the WTO. United States domestic law, known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, is a legal obstacle to a full WTO relationship between the United States and the PRC, because it requires annual review of the PRC's most-favored nation (MFN) trade status (since 1998 termed 'normal trade relations' status). Recognizing the United States must extend permanent MFN treatment to the PRC to avail itself of all rights under the WTO with respect to the PRC, this article explores the ways in which the US Congress has previously extended permanent MFN treatment to countries subject to the Jackson-Vanik amendment. This article also takes note of proposed US legislation with respect to the PRC's entry into the WTO. Finally, this article concludes that the US Congress plays an important and probably decisive rule in ensuring that the United States and the PRC enjoy a full WTO relationship.", 01 September 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1999, Pages 497–510, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.3.497
6,"Notes, comments and developments. Some considerations on trade barriers erected for non-economic reasons and WTO obligations","['B Jansen', ' M Lugard']","The issue discussed in this note concerns the jurisdictional limitation of Article XX GATT 1994. The authors develop four distinct categories of trade barriers erected to protect non-economic interests, so as to assess their acceptability under WTO rules. The first category concerns barriers put in place because of reasons of public health or the environment within the country taking the measure, i.e. based on the territoriality principle. The second category concerns barriers implemented with the sole objective of 'convincing' or coercing a foreign government to change its policy in a given sector, i.e. 'extraterritorial' measures. The third category concerns barriers raised because of environmental concerns outside the country taking the measure, but where a link with the country's territory can be established (for example, when a country implements an import ban so as to save a highly migratory species). Finally, the authors discuss whether a fourth category could be envisaged - and justified under Article XX GAT 1994 - where there is no obvious territorial link with the country imposing the trade barrier, but where the measure would be considered necessary to address an environmental concern elsewhere: could such environmental concern justify the application of a 'universal jurisdiction'?", 01 September 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1999, Pages 530–536, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.3.530
