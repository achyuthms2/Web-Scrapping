0,WTO Dispute Settlement as Judicial Supervision,['Yuji Iwasawa'],"This article distinguishes ‘judicial supervision’ and ‘dispute settlement’. Judicial supervision is a mechanism to control and secure compliance of international obligations undertaken by States by judicial means. Its notable feature is that States which have not been injured directly may initiate judicial proceedings for the purpose of putting an end to violations of international obligations by another State. This article compares the dispute settlement procedures in the WTO with those in the ICJ, and demonstrates that the WTO procedures have the character of judicial supervision. It also focuses on the position assigned to third States by the WTO and the ICJ, and shows that the WTO allows participation of third States in its adjudicatory process much more liberally than the ICJ. A WTO member can bring a complaint to the WTO, even if it has suffered no injury in a concrete and material sense. Multiple disputes involving more than two States are a regular feature in the WTO. Third party intervention is virtually automatically allowed. It could be suggested that the WTO allows participation of third States in its adjudicatory process liberally because compulsory jurisdiction has been achieved and because the WTO adjudicatory procedures have the character of judicial supervision. The WTO and ICJ procedures are both judicial, but they differ considerably in character.", 01 June 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 2, June 2002, Pages 287–305, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.2.287
1,Adjudicating Compliance in the WTO: A Review of DSU Article 21.5,"['Jason E. Kearns', ' Steve Charnovitz']","This article provides an analytical overview of one of the most important provisions in the WTO's Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes. That is Article 21.5 which provides for a review of whether governmental measures taken to comply do in fact achieve compliance with WTO rules. Part I discusses the purposes that Article 21.5 serves and how they relate to the larger objectives of dispute settlement. Part II presents a table summarizing the Article 21.5 caselaw through February 2002, and then draws a few conclusions from that practice as to how well Article 21.5 is working. Part III discusses some procedural issues that have arisen in the new case law. Among the questions examined are which governments have standing to invoke Article 21.5 and what limits exist on raising new claims. The article concludes that Article 21.5 compliance panels and the Appellate Body are developing an innovative body of law that will serve a growing role in the cooperative management of the multilateral trading system.", 01 June 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 2, June 2002, Pages 331–352, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.2.331
2,Attribution of Conduct to the State: How the Rules of State Responsibility may be Applied Within the WTO Dispute Settlement System,['Santiago M. Villalpando'],"The present article identifies the tests that make it possible to determine whether a breach of obligations under the WTO agreements is a conduct of the Member and therefore entails its responsibility under international law. It examines the relevant provisions of the WTO agreements and the case law of the dispute settlement bodies in light of the principles of the law of State responsibility codified by the UN International Law Commission. Special consideration is given to the issues related to the conduct of organs of the State, territorial units, para‐statal entities (including State trading enterprises) and individuals or private corporations.", 01 June 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 2, June 2002, Pages 393–420, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.2.393
3,Discriminatory Safeguards in the Light of the Admission of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organization,['Fabio Spadi'],"Discriminatory safeguards underwent a peculiar destiny in the multilateral trading system. Traditionally considered illegal, they have been resorted to in two main instances: in one case to permit developed countries to protect certain sectors of their industry against fierce competition of the developing world, in another to shield the system against potential abuse of the rules and principles of free trade on the part of State‐trading countries admitted within the ranks of GATT. The Agreement on Safeguards, while establishing once and for all that traditional safeguard measures have to be applied across the board, nevertheless allows selectivity in certain instances, both directly and indirectly. Furthermore, China's recent Accession Protocol to the WTO includes an outright selective safeguards clause which, consistent with previous State practice, satisfies two functions: it can serve as a guarantee against possible abuse stemming from the still opaque Chinese economic and administrative background and it can also be used to protect the markets of WTO members from too strong Chinese economic competition. Though the special mechanism is framed within a discipline that is clearly derived from that of GATT and the Agreement on Safeguards, it maintains its own particularity which will effectively limit China's full integration into the WTO until 2013, when said mechanism will terminate.", 01 June 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 2, June 2002, Pages 421–443, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.2.421
4,The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing: Safeguard Actions from 1995 to 2001,"['Sung Jae Kim', ' Kenneth A. Reinert', ' G. Chris Rodrigo']","The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing is one of the most significant outcomes of the Uruguay Round. While the ATC promises to deliver a significant amount of liberalization during the 1995 to 2004 transition period, trade policy analysts and developing country representatives have expressed concern about the role of ATC Article 6 safeguard provisions. This paper reviews the safeguard activity under the ATC during the 1995 to 2001 period. In earlier years, there is evidence of abuse of the mechanism by the United States, but in later years, the primary use of ATC safeguards has been by Latin American countries. Overall, the ATC safeguard provisions have proved to be effective both in limiting most safeguard abuses and in carving out a new textiles and clothing regime within the WTO.", 01 June 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 2, June 2002, Pages 445–468, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.2.445
5,Optimal Level of Financial Regulation under the GATS: A Regulatory Competition and Cooperation Framework for Capital Adequacy and Disclosure of Information,"['Mahmood Bagheri', ' Chizu Nakajima']","Optimal level of regulation and regulatory reform seem to be an undisputed objective. However, in the context of financial regulation there are differences and disagreements over the optimal level of disclosure of information and capital adequacy standards. In this paper, instead of offering a substantive solution, we argue for a competitive process through which the optimal level of disclosure of information and capital adequacy standards are likely to emerge. The solution, which we suggest, consists of an international framework combining competition and cooperation among national regulatory regimes. We identify WTO/GATS as such a framework, which facilitates both regulatory competition and regulatory cooperation. The ultimate outcome of this integrated process, which simultaneously emphasizes liberalization and regulation of financial markets is the emergence of an optimal level of regulation related to mandatory disclosure of information and capital adequacy standards.", 01 June 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 2, June 2002, Pages 507–530, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.2.507
