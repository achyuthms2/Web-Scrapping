0,JIEL Debate: Methodological Pluralism and its Critics in International Economic Law Research,['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"Section II discusses six different conceptions of justifying international economic law (IEL). Section III argues that the ‘dual nature’ of modern IEL requires limiting ‘Westphalian conceptions’ of ‘international law among states’ through protection of ‘cosmopolitan rights’ and judicial remedies of citizens in IEL. Section IV explains why past doctrinal disputes among legal positivists, natural law advocates, and social conceptions of law have lost much of their relevance for interpreting IEL. Section V suggests that protecting transnational ‘aggregate public goods' requires constitutional approaches to IEL. Section VI explains the need for comparative institutional research so as to improve the functioning of horizontally and vertically interdependent public goods regimes. Section VII discusses why ‘cosmopolitan public goods regimes' have protected rights and transnational rule of law more effectively for the benefit of citizens than the prevailing ‘Westphalian conceptions’. Section VIII argues that the inadequate parliamentary and civil society control of multilevel economic regulation must be compensated by multilevel judicial protection of cosmopolitan rights protecting ‘participatory’ and ‘deliberative democracy’, ‘access to justice’, ‘active liberty’, and human rights in IEL. Section IX concludes that the permanent fact of ‘reasonable disagreement’ requires respect for ‘constitutional pluralism’ in IEL in accordance with the ‘subsidiarity principle’. The legitimate diversity and competing conceptions of ‘principles of justice’ justify judicial deference via-à-vis diverse conceptions of human rights, economic cosmopolitan rights, corresponding ‘duties to protect’ and ‘corporate responsibilities’ as relevant context for interpreting IEL.", 20 December 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 4, December 2012, Pages 921–970, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs040
1,"China's Rare Earths Export Quotas: Out of the China-Raw Materials Gate, But Past the WTO's Finish Line?","['Han-Wei Liu', ' John Maughan']","Several recent studies have discussed the ramifications of the China – Raw Materials case for China's rare earths. However, none of these studies has conducted a thorough investigation of China's current export quota regime for rare earths or how it might stand up under WTO rules, assuming that it would be treated the same. This article makes no such assumption, investigating China's export quota regime for rare earths as it stands in early June 2012. The regime is somewhat improved over that applied during the Raw Materials case and could allow a more favourable WTO ruling. However, if General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) disciplines are interpreted narrowly, as in China – Raw Materials, this article finds that the current regime still falls short of certain GATT exceptions. This article informs future analyses of China's export quota regime for rare earths. Beyond the case of China, it also invites discussion on the appropriate amount of ‘policy space’ WTO Members should enjoy for imposing export quotas under the relevant GATT disciplines for resource conservation and environmental protection.", 17 November 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 4, December 2012, Pages 971–1005, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs037
2,Applicability of GATT Article XX in China – Raw Materials: A Clash within the WTO Agreement,['Bin GU'],"The Appellate Body’s interpretation in China – Raw Materials regarding the applicability of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article XX to China’s Accession Protocol is highly controversial and stimulates wide debates in academia. The controversy is rooted in the absence of an explicit mention of ‘consistency with the GATT 1994’ in Paragraph 11.3 of China’s Accession Protocol. That absence constrains China’s defense in instances when it must violate its export duty elimination commitments under the Accession Protocol by resorting to GATT Article XX. This article disagrees with the Appellate Body’s legal interpretation in China – Raw Materials and provides a critical review of the Appellate Body’s logical principle that ‘absence equates to waiver’. The Appellate Body’s interpretation on the relationship between GATT Article XX and China’s Accession Protocol contradicted former Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) practices, demonstrated a failure to interpret the WTO Agreement in a systemic manner, and unfortunately resulted in inappropriateness in treaty interpretation.", 20 November 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 4, December 2012, Pages 1007–1031, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs039
3,Horizontal Mechanism Proposal for the Resolution of Non-Tariff Barrier Disputes at the WTO: An Analysis,['Véronique Fraser'],"On 3 February 2010, a group of countries representing 88 distinct World Trade Organization (WTO) Members presented a proposal for procedures for the facilitation of solutions to non-tariff barrier disputes. This proposal is in line with Paragraph 16 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration which provides for the reduction or appropriate elimination of non-tariff barriers, since they constitute barriers that affect market access opportunities for other WTO Members. This article analyzes whether the new procedures are properly designed to effectively meet their own stated goals, but also if they are compatible with the general objectives of the WTO and the Dispute Settlement Body.", 17 November 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 4, December 2012, Pages 1033–1073, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs038
4,US – Clove Cigarettes and US – Tuna II (Mexico): Implications for the Role of Regulatory Purpose under Article III:4 of the GATT,['Weihuan Zhou'],"The resolution of the issue of what role regulatory purpose might play in adjudicating the consistency of origin-neutral measures under the GATT National Treatment rule is essential to the resolution of the tension between trade liberalization and domestic autonomy with respect to the use of domestic policy instruments. As far as internal non-fiscal measures are concerned, the Appellate Body has yet to clarify its position on whether purpose should be considered in the step of determining ‘less favourable treatment’ under Article III:4. The Appellate Body’s recent decisions in US – Clove Cigarettes and US – Tuna II (Mexico) indicate that it continues to be reluctant to assign purpose a role under Article III:4, despite its explicit consideration of purpose in assessing ‘less favourable treatment’ under the National Treatment provision of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. These decisions also suggest that, in examining the policy claims raised in these two cases, the Appellate Body has employed its approach to ‘arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination’ in the context of the Chapeau of GATT Article XX.", 28 November 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 4, December 2012, Pages 1075–1122, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs041
