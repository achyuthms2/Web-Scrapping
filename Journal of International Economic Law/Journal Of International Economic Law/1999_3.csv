0,Better rules for a new millennium: a warning against undemocratic developments in the WTO,['MCEJ Bronckers'],"The theme of this article is that the quality of WTO rule-making needs to improve, particularly as the WTO expands into new areas in the upcoming Millennium Round. The quality of existing WTO rules is deficient. This is illustrated with examples taken from the WTO agreements on intellectual property and telecommunications services. Furthermore the article shows that, in view of institutional constraints, it is particularly difficult within the WTO to clarify or replace inadequate rules. Now that the WTO's dispute settlement machinery is so effective, rule-makers may be tempted to leave the resolution of difficult problems to litigation. This, however, leads too easily to undemocratic surprises and, therefore, a weakening of the organization. The article concludes with recommendations for the negotiators of the new Round to ensure the adoption of better rules.", 01 December 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 4, December 1999, Pages 547–566, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.4.547
1,Can financiers learn from traders?,"['G Hufbauer', ' E Wada']","Over the past three decades, the world trading system has functioned well, while the financial system has stumbled. While the trading system cannot provide a template for redesigning the financial system, it can provide useful lessons. The primary goal of the world trading system has been to liberalize commerce. By contrast, the primary goal of the world financial system has been to stabilize markets. The trading system has nonetheless devised useful means for anticipating and coping with shocks. In the pre-crisis period, the trading system has stressed the articulation of binding agreements as to predictable rules. In the mid-crisis period, the trading system's distinction between external and internal causes has political, but not economic, resonance in financial shocks. In the post-crisis period, effective investigation of business conditions abroad and meaningful adjustment to world markets are both useful lessons.", 01 December 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 4, December 1999, Pages 567–601, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.4.567
2,Has the appellate body erred? An appraisal and criticism of the ruling in the WTO Hormones case,"['R Quick', ' A Blüthner']","In the Hormones case the Appellate Body has sharply criticized the legal analysis of the lower panels, upholding seven findings, reversing six and modifying four. This article looks critically at the Appellate Body's interpretation of certain issues and concludes that its ruling contains a number of legal weaknesses. Not only does the Appellate Body creatively interpret the law without giving a clear reasoning for such interpretation (burden of proof), but also leaves certain issues undecided (the relationship between general and specific obligations of the SPS Agreement as well as the relationship between the GATT 1994 and the SPS Agreement). With its broad interpretation of risk assessment and its insistence on the notion of judicial economy, the Appellate Body fails to serve its fundamental role in assisting the DSB to achieve a satisfactory settlement of the matter.", 01 December 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 4, December 1999, Pages 603–639, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.4.603
3,"The WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures as applied in the first three SPS disputes. EC - Hormones, Australia - salmon and Japan - varietals",['J Pauwelyn'],"One of the new WTO agreements that panels and the Appellate Body had to deal with in a number of recent disputes is the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures. This article focuses on the legal principles of the SPS Agreement as interpreted and established by Appellate Body and panel jurisprudence in the two most prominent cases under the SPS Agreement, the EC - Hormones case and the Australia - Salmon case, as well as the recently concluded Japan - Varietals case. Substantive rights and obligations such as scope of application, scientific evidence, risk assessment and the factors to be looked at in assessing risk, provisional measures, the acceptable level of risk for WTO Members, non-discrimination under Articles 2.3 and 5.5 SPS, and measures in the presence of international standards are examined. The above-mentioned cases also involved a number of procedural issues with particular relevance to disputes on SPS measures, such as the panel's terms of reference, the burden of proving whether a risk exists, the extent of a panel's investigation and the role of scientific experts. The status of implementation of reports is also briefly addressed.", 01 December 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 4, December 1999, Pages 641–664, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.4.641
4,Competition law and the millennium round,['EM Fox'],"To advance the debate about whether competition should be on the agenda of the World Trade Organization, this paper identifies the keypoint at which trade law and competition law meet: the blockage of market access by anti-competitive restraints. At this open-market intersection, there is a synergy to be captured by combining principles of free trade and principles of free competition. The author proposes a simple architecture, with a choice of law principle for seamlessly incorporating into the WTO a discipline against private market access restraints. The author cautions against indiscriminately raising antitrust issues to an international level and against doing so under a trade law banner. For the world competition issues that are not trade issues, a free-standing World Competition Forum is proposed, interactive where appropriate with the WTO.", 01 December 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 4, December 1999, Page 665, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.4.665
5,Antitrust issues arising our of actual or potential enforcement of trade laws,['J Davidow'],"A WTO working group is now studying the trade law/competition law interface. The group has concentrated on market access issues and policy analysis, but has not yet focused specifically on actual cases involving both bodies of law. The United States experience is instructive in this regard. US cases in four areas illuminate the key issues at the interface, and point the way toward the development of international norms. (1) Firms may face antitrust liability for knowingly advancing false claims or evidence in trade cases, but are protected by a broad right of advocacy and strict rules of causation; (2) firms may settle trade cases on a price basis, usually subject to public review requirements; (3) price agreements among two or more trade case defendants or plaintiffs will usually not be antitrust exempt; (4) damage liability for price-fixing will normally not be eliminated merely because price increases were one way to react to a governmental dumping finding.", 01 December 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 4, December 1999, Pages 681–693, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.4.681
6,Telecom reforms in developing countries and the outlook for electronic commerce,['P Bhatnagar'],"This article looks at the elements that are necessary for the introduction of electronic commerce in developing countries. Two elements determine the successful adoption of e-commerce in developing countries: access to cheap information technology equipment for consumers and the supply of telecommunications services to computer and internet users at low rates. In the World Trade Organization (WTO), negotiations have been conducted and agreements concluded that contribute to lowering prices of both telecommunications services and computer hardware and software. The relevant agreements are the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and the 4th Protocol of GATS relating to basic telecommunications. The degree to which developing country members have implemented both agreements varies considerably. With respect to the ITA, general trends concerning tariff cuts are established for different products most relevant for e-commerce. To determine the liberalization of telecommunications services under the GATS, different parameters showing the possibility of competition among service providers are established.", 01 December 1999,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 2, Issue 4, December 1999, Pages 695–712, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/2.4.695
