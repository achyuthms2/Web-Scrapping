0,The WTO’s First Antitrust Case – Mexican Telecom: A Sleeping Victory for Trade and Competition,['Eleanor M. Fox'],"A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute panel has decided the WTO’s first antitrust case. It resolved the matter in favour of the United States’ claim that Mexico had anticompetitively facilitated exploitative prices and a cartel that raised the price of terminating cross-border telephone calls in Mexico and thereby harmed trade and competition. The case is Mexico – Measures Affecting Telecommunications Services (April 2004) (‘the Mexican telecom case’). This essay argues that if the WTO’s antitrust clause was in fact triggered (which is a point of contention), Mexico’s conduct violated its obligations. Furthermore, it argues that the GATS antitrust obligation in the telecommunications sector should be acknowledged as occupying an important place at the intersection of trade, competition and industrial policies. Antitrust law is the other side of the coin of liberal trade law. Antitrust law opens markets by prohibiting private and other commercial restraints, while trade law opens markets by prohibiting public restraints. Before Mexican telecom, no legal discipline was regarded as copious or flexible enough to address combined public and private restraints. In particular, nations were allowed free rein to privilege national champions that harmed competition in and out of their country, imposing costs on outsiders as well as on their own people. A positive reading of the antitrust clause helps to fill the gap.", 08 May 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 2, June 2006, Pages 271–292, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl012
1,The Case for a Multilateral Agreement on Competition Policy: A Developing Country Perspective,['Aditya Bhattacharjea'],"Although the issue of trade and competition policy has been dropped from the Work Programmes of the Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, it continues to be discussed in other fora and may return to the WTO after the completion of the Round. This article assesses the case for an agreement from the perspective of developing countries. It begins by reviewing the ‘development dimension’ of the WTO debate and then examines three specific antitrust issues that were of considerable relevance to developing countries but were not pursued: export cartels, anti-dumping and intellectual property rights (IPRs). There follows a critical assessment of the empirical and theoretical arguments for the kind of agreement that was being advocated to deal with international cartels. Alternative proposals, involving developing countries ‘outsourcing’ antitrust enforcement to developed countries, are also sceptically examined, as is the relevance for developing countries of the kind of competition policy that is currently in place in developed countries. Finally, a general approach to international trade agreements suggests that developing countries had nothing to gain from the proposal that was on the table, and the article concludes by proposing a range of more suitable alternatives.", 12 May 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 2, June 2006, Pages 293–323, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl009
2,Multilateral Rules on Investment: Is Forward Movement Possible?,['Pierre Sauvé'],"This paper explores the forces that have to date impeded the development of a multilateral set of rules on investment. The paper chronicles the policy- and rule-making debates that took place in the World Trade Organization’s (WTO’s) Working Group on Trade and Investment (WGTI) and advances a number of political economy reasons that contributed to the derailment of investment discussions under the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). The paper highlights elements of a development-friendly international investment regime and identifies various scenarios for imparting forward movement to international negotiations on investment issues at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels.", 08 May 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 2, June 2006, Pages 325–355, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl011
3,The Evolving American Policy on Investment Protection: Evidence from Recent FTAs and the 2004 Model BIT,"['Gilbert Gagné', ' Jean-Frédéric Morin']","Twelve years after the inception of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the US policy on the protection of foreign investment is evolving. This article compares the provisions on investment in the recent US free trade agreements (FTAs) and the 2004 model bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with NAFTA’s. While most of the provisions are similar, some differences can be identified, both in substantive and procedural forms. We explain this evolution by a learning process of the US administration from the NAFTA experience. We argue that the new features of the FTAs and of the revised model BIT result from the US interest in reaching a better balance between the protection of investment and the protection of state sovereignty. This American concern stems from a reaction to the claims filed by foreign investors under NAFTA Chapter 11, at least some of which were perceived as ‘frivolous’ by the US government. However, the recent US FTAs and model BIT do not reveal a thorough policy reorientation but rather adjustments to the policy at the basis of NAFTA’s investment chapter.", 04 May 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 2, June 2006, Pages 357–382, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl006
4,Securing Compliance Through the WTO Dispute Settlement System: Implementation of DSB Recommendations,['Yuka Fukunaga'],"The World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system has been making substantial contributions to improved compliance with the WTO Agreements. Of particular note are the elaborate multistage mechanisms installed in the system that facilitate and ensure the implementation of the DSB recommendations. However, these multistage mechanisms are not devoid of problems and shortcomings. Several improvements are proposed by Members and scholars but a number of disagreements exist, reflecting varied understanding of the nature of the dispute settlement system. Against this background, this article first analyses the nature of the dispute settlement system. It argues that the primary purpose of the dispute settlement system is not to secure compliance in abstracto but to settle a dispute and remedy injury, and its compliance function is exerted only in the course of dispute settlement. Thereafter, in the light of the nature of the dispute settlement system, this article presents a comprehensive analysis of the manner in which the multistage mechanisms currently function and how they should function.", 08 May 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 2, June 2006, Pages 383–426, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl007
5,Africa in the First Decade of WTO Dispute Settlement,['Victor Mosoti'],"African countries have largely been absent as players at the WTO dispute settlement system in its first decade. In recent literature, this has been attributed to a number of factors, among them, the low volume of trade with an export base often characterized by single unprocessed commodities, a complicated and expensive dispute settlement system, inadequate legal expertise and a less litigious approach to possible disputes particularly when major trading and donor partners are involved. By showing how and to what extent African countries have participated in GATT and WTO disputes, as well as in the DSU review negotiations and other related processes, the present article argues that this weak participation by large sections of the WTO membership is a danger to the long-term “predictability” function of the WTO, and could undermine the usefulness of the entire process eventually. It closes with various proposals on how the problem may be addressed.", 11 May 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 2, June 2006, Pages 427–453, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl013
6,Public Services and the GATS,['Rudolf Adlung'],"The status of public services is one of the most hotly debated issues surrounding the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). In principle, there are two approaches to define such services: an institutional approach focusing on the conditions governing supply (e.g. ownership status and market organization) and a functional approach based on the policy objectives that may be involved (e.g. quality-related objectives and concepts of universal access). Given the diversity of existing arrangements among WTO Members, with significant variations over time, the former approach does not appear appropriate. The services provided by government-owned facilities, whose costs are covered directly by the State, may well be indistinguishable, for all practical purposes, from the services provided by private commercial operators under appropriate regulations or incentive mechanisms. This article discusses the relevance of the GATS for different arrangements that governments may use to meet typical public service objectives. All conceivable arrangements, whether based on public monopolies, or regulated or subsidized private supplies, or combinations thereof, are compatible per se with the Agreement. Recent regulatory and technical developments have broadened the scope for – possibly more efficient – market-based solutions, whose credibility may be enhanced by the assumption of commitments under the GATS. There is no common template, however. It is at the end for each WTO Member to decide, sector-by-sector, on the appropriate policy approach and the pros and cons of binding access conditions under the Agreement.", 04 May 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 2, June 2006, Pages 455–485, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl010
7,Global Trade Policy Development in a Two-Track System,['Larry Crump'],"The World Bank identifies two trends within the international trading system: multilateral negotiations sponsored by GATT/WTO based on evolving rules grounded in non-discrimination, and bilateral and regional negotiations between nations that reduce trade barriers on a reciprocal and preferential basis. This article asks how we might enhance the global trade policy development process through interaction and coordination between these two trade policy development systems. It seeks an understanding of the nature of bilateral trade negotiations so that we can compare bilateral and WTO-sponsored multilateral processes. In so doing, we can observe how these two systems naturally interact thus enabling us to consider how that interaction may be better designed to enhance the international trade policy development system. After examining current trends in bilateral and regional trade negotiations, this article considers the opportunities and challenges of a two-track system for developing trade policy by examining bilateral trade negotiations conducted by Australia, Singapore and the United States. The article concludes with observations that may assist in re-framing the current debate over bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations and includes recommendations for the effective management of a two-track trade policy development system.", 09 March 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 2, June 2006, Pages 487–510, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl005
