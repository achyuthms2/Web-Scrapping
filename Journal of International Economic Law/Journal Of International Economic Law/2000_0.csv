0,International economic law in times that are interesting,['JH Jackson'],"As the turn of the millennium, John H. Jackson gives some of his thoughts on the 'State of International Economic Law'. This note overviews the major recent developments, in particular analyzing the financial crisis and the evolving Word Trade Organization with a view to the fundamental and constitutional questions they trigger. It also addresses the challenges of globalization and sets out some perspectives for the future.", 01 March 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2000, Pages 3–14, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.1.3
1,The WTO dispute settlement system,['WJ Davey'],William J. Davey served as the Director of the Legal Affairs Division of the World Trade Organization between 1995 and 1999. In this note he reviews the first four years of WTO dispute settlement and gives some of his preliminary judgements about the new WTO dispute procedures., 01 March 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2000, Pages 15–18, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.1.15
2,The WTO constitution and human rights,['E-U Petersmann'],"Human rights and liberal trade rules (including WTO rules) are based on the same values: individual freedom and responsibility (e.g. to adjust to competition); non-discrimination; rule of law; access to courts and adjudication to disputes; promotion of social welfare through peaceful cooperation among free citizens; parliamentary approval of national and international rules. The non-economic values of WTO law are no less important for the human rights and welfare of citizens than the economic welfare effects of liberal trade. Like the EC, the WTO can and should become an advocate not only of economic freedom, but of human freedom more generally. This article argues in favour of constitutional reforms of WTO law so as to take civil society and human rights more seriously.", 01 March 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2000, Pages 19–25, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.1.19
3,The WTO in international law: tradition continued or new frontier?,['DM McRae'],"The question of the relationship between international law and international trade law has taken on a greater significance with the development of the legal regime of the WTO. Although in a formal legal sense the WTO differs little from other international organizations, its legal regime is built on assumptions that are often at variance with those underlying the traditional sovereign state model. Moreover, the WTO dispute settlement mechanism is playing an active role in the development of the substantive and procedural content of international law. The contributions of this process include clarification of the rules relating to treaty interpretation, and the development of rights of access for non-state entities. These developments have implications for some of the assumptions on which international law traditionally has been based.", 01 March 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2000, Pages 27–41, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.1.27
4,A perspective on trade and labor rights,"['C McCrudden', ' A Davies']","Recent debates about the role of the International Labor Organization and the World Trade Organization are considered in the context of an examination of the appropriate relationship between international trade law and labor rights. After a brief history of the issue, consideration is given to how far there is a conflict between trade liberalization and labor rights, identifying different ways in which tensions may arise. Currently, four ways of dealing with these tensions exist in an uneasy relationship with each other: a unilateral model, an NGO model, a regional model, and a multilateral model (concentrating on the ILO). If dissatisfaction with these current models grows, two alternatives are identified (rather speculatively) as possible. In one, involuntary multilateralism, the WTO adjudicatory institutions are called on to determine whether actions are in compliance with existing trade disciplines. In a second alternative, voluntary multilaterlism, states agree to give the WTO a more clearly articulated role in addressing labor issues. The debate on such issues should involve all the existing international institutional actors, including the WTO. Finally, in this context, the issue of who else should participate in this debate is identified.", 01 March 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2000, Pages 43–62, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.1.43
5,Distributed governance at the WTO-WIPO: an evolving model for open-architecture integrated governance,['FM Abbott'],"WTO governance has traditionally reflected the interests of producers channeled through government trade negotiators. The producer-driven governance model is not suited to the highly integrated international society of the 21st century. The WTO governance structure should be adapted to account for more diverse interests, including those of marginalized developing countries, NGOs, and individuals. One aspect of this adaptation should involve more highly integrated relations between the WTO and other multilateral institutions. The inter-institutional relationship that has evolved between the WTO and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round evidences a number of characteristics that might usefully form the basis for relations between the WTO and other international organizations. The WTO-WIPO relationship effectively enhances the breadth of subject matter interests and the administrative capacity of each organization, and it provides a suitable forum for the negotiation of incremental and experimental intellectual property rules that are needed in response to technological change. A second aspect of institutional adaptation concerns increasing the participation of wider segments of international society in multilateral rule-making. The WIPO Internet Domain Name Process was a unique governance exercise that employed elements of direct democracy at the international level and the management of an organizational bureaucracy (the WIPO International Bureau). This type of process might usefully be employed in other contexts, such as by the FAO/WHO in developing health and safety guidelines in connection with genetically modified organisms (GMOs).", 01 March 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2000, Pages 63–81, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.1.63
6,Subsidiarity perspectives on the new trade agenda,"['P Sauvé', ' AB Zampetti']","Despite the substantial achievements of the Uruguay Round, the trading system is faced with new and growing demands to extend the liberalization of international commerce and the purview of its rules in new areas hitherto considered only of domestic concern. This new trade agenda is mainly driven by the increasing integration of the world economy that has multiplied the interlinkages and reciprocal impact of domestic policies and measures. In this context it may be useful to use the notion of subsidiarity as a benchmark to assess the desirability and effectiveness of addressing policy challenges at the international level. The paper argues that in the case of investment, competition policy, and domestic (economic) regulation a multilateral rule-making response represents a first-best outcome, if the nature of the trans-border externality, market or policy failure it addresses is inherently or increasingly global in character.", 01 March 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2000, Pages 83–114, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.1.83
7,Trade liberalization and cultural policy,"['ME Footer', ' CB Graber']","This article examines the tension between global trade liberalization and the pursuit of cultural policies by national governments. It reviews the background to the discourse over trade and culture and a range of domestic cultural policy measures. Attention is also focused on the emergent issues governing the relationship between intellectual property, trade and culture, and recent disputes involving these at the WTO. The article then analyses the pervasiveness of globalization and its impact on the way in which cultural goods and services are traded and distributed, using the new media technologies, and its effects on cultural identity. The final section of the article discusses some prospects for the treatment of trade and culture exception to trade is rejected in favour of the application of specific rules governing trade and culture.", 01 March 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2000, Pages 115–144, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.1.115
8,Procedural overview of the WTO EC - banana dispute,"['M Salas', ' JH Jackson']","This note provides a road-map to the many decisions triggered by the EU banana regulation at three levels: GATT/WTO procedures, the European Court of Justice, and German Courts.", 01 March 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 1, March 2000, Pages 145–166, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.1.145
