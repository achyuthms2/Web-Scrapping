0,Maintaining the WTO's Supremacy in the International Trade Order: A Proposal to Refine and Revise the Role of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism,"['Julien Chaisse', ' Mitsuo Matsushita']","In light of the stagnating World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, this article argues that WTO should not only focus on the development of new rules or the resolution of disputes, but should also develop ‘soft law’ on the basis of informal mechanisms as the successful experiences of the International Competition Network or the International Monetary Fund demonstrate. In this respect, WTO should extend and refine the role of its Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM) in order to be able to address essential issues of contemporary economic concerns and, hence, remain at the centre of global governance. This article explains how the TPRM role should be refined and revised with a view to cover key areas of international trade governance, such as harmonization and coordination of preferential trade agreements as well as convergence of measures dealing with greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental policies which are two key issues questioning the WTO’s supremacy in the international trade order.", 22 January 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 1, March 2013, Pages 9–36, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs043
1,WTO Space for National Regulation: Requiem for a Diagonal Vector Test,['James Flett'],"This article examines the concept of de facto breaches of a national treatment obligation in the context of Articles III:2 (fiscal measures) and III:4 (regulatory measures) of the GATT 1994; and Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement (technical regulations), particularly following the Appellate Body Reports in the Clove Cigarettes, Tuna, and COOL cases. The same problem of balancing a federal trade interest and local fiscal or regulatory autonomy arises in other tiered jurisdictions. It is not solved by mechanistically comparing the different treatment of one (imported) good and a different (domestic) good, that is, through a diagonal vector of comparison. Rather, it can only be solved by enquiring into what the true objective of the measure is, whether it is legitimate, whether the measure contributes to the objective, and whether there is another equally effective but less trade restrictive measure available. In short, whether the measure is necessary or reasonable. These questions are not part of the analysis of the product (which is competition based) or part of delimiting the like domestic product category (which simply has to be identical), but part of the analysis of less favourable treatment. This has several implications, summarized in the conclusion of this article. In particular, this article identifies the root cause of an earlier drift in WTO jurisprudence away from a balanced approach to regulatory autonomy and towards a diagonal vector of comparison as being a misinterpretation of the Ad Article to Article III:2. This Ad Article does not refer to the relationship between the imported and domestic product categories (which is the true ‘like product' issue). Rather, it refers to the question of whether two different goods can be combined as one product on both the import and domestic sides of the comparison (correctly referred to as the ‘product' issue) because they are directly competitive or substitutable. This problem only arises in de facto cases, because in de jure cases it is necessary to identify a distinction based exclusively on origin. In the most recent cases the tail (the TBT Agreement) has wagged the dog (the GATT 1994), heralding a further improvement in the previously unsettled balance between the trade interest and national fiscal and regulatory autonomy.", 21 January 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 1, March 2013, Pages 37–90, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs044
2,Discrimination in International Mobile Roaming Regulation: Implications of WTO Law,['Tania Voon'],"High international mobile roaming charges have created concerns for consumers and regulators around the world, leading to discussion and activity in a range of international organizations as well as national and regional bodies, including in the course of ongoing negotiations. Policy-makers seem inclined to intervene in the market to reduce these charges, but the complexities of international telecommunications and the way in which roaming services are supplied present a barrier to a practicable regulatory solution at the local level. Proposals for bilateral agreements have therefore emerged in some jurisdictions, often involving capping wholesale roaming charges imposed by domestic telecommunications operators on foreign telecommunications operators from particular countries on a reciprocal basis. Before concluding any such agreement, governments must ensure that they fully consider their international trade obligations, including the most-favoured nation obligation in Article II of the World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Trade in Services. A potential violation of this obligation could be avoided if the roaming arrangement is carefully structured to ensure that it falls within the exception for economic integration in Article V of that agreement.", 19 February 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 1, March 2013, Pages 91–117, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt002
3,Reassessing APEC’s role as a Trans-Regional Economic Architecture: Legal and Policy Dimensions,['Pasha L. Hsieh'],"This article examines the two-decade evolution of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the future prospects for Asian regionalism. It argues that while APEC retains advantages over competing regional structures, it should undergo reforms to accelerate the Bogor Goals and ensure its complementarity with the World Trade Organization (WTO). The article first analyzes the impact of stake-holding countries’ trade policies on APEC’s structure and development. By assessing APEC’s soft-law mechanism, it explores APEC’s WTO-plus contributions that reinvigorated the International Technology Agreement negotiations and improved supply chain facilitation. APEC’s goal of creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) can overcome structural limitations and serve as an effective ‘Plan B’ for the Doha Round impasse. Nonetheless, caution should be given to legal challenges to the pathways to an FTAAP such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Finally, the article calls for reforms that will enhance APEC’s institution-building and monitoring system. Such reforms will strengthen APEC’s role under the multilateral trading system and reenergize the public–private partnership for trans-Pacific integration.", 24 January 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 1, March 2013, Pages 119–158, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs045
4,Transparent Financial Innovation in a Post-Crisis Environment,['Panagiotis Delimatsis'],"The recent stunning failure of financial institutions has put regulatory intervention high on the agenda of governments. Adequate risk monitoring, including by credit rating agencies (CRAs), as well as measurement and management have proven a daunting task, whereas regulation of innovative financial instruments has not brought about adequate disclosure and transparency. Before the recent financial crisis, financial innovation was regarded as inextricably linked with economic growth and aggregate welfare. In the wake of the crisis, criticism as to the utility of financial innovation became more unequivocal. After reviewing the virtues and pitfalls of financial innovation, the article analyses the main transparency initiatives undertaken in the EU and the USA in the aftermath of the crisis to harness various financial innovations that have marked the history of financial markets in the past three decades, including hedge funds, derivatives, and credit ratings. Furthermore, the article critically assesses the likely impact of such regulations on the future of financial innovation. In addition, the article reviews the approach to financial innovation that the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade Organization adopted in the 1990s and assesses the likely impact of the recent financial crisis on this stance. As the perimeter of regulation grows and countries become more suspicious about home-country financial regulation, trade in financial services is unlikely to remain unaffected. Nevertheless, the GATS appears to be running out of analytical tools, a fact that undermines its global role. Within this new landscape, the GATS is bound to adapt.", 21 February 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 1, March 2013, Pages 159–210, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt001
5,Economic Stability and Economic Governance in the Euro Area: What the European Crisis can Teach on the Limits of Economic Integration,['Federico Lupo Pasini'],"The recent European economic crisis has dramatically exposed the failures of the various institutional mechanisms in place to maintain economic stability in Europe, and has unveiled the difficulty in achieving international coordination on fiscal and financial stability policies. Drawing on the European experience, this article analyzes the concept of economic stability1 in international law and highlights the peculiar problems connected to its maintenance or promotion. First, we demonstrate that policies that safeguard and protect economic stability are largely regulated and managed at the national level, due to their inextricable relationship with the exercise of national political power. Until recently, more limited levels of pan-European integration did not make the coordination of economic stability policies seem necessary. However, a much deeper level of economic integration makes it very difficult to tackle an international economic crisis through national responses. If EU Member states wish to maintain and deepen economic integration, they must accept an erosion of sovereignty over their economic stability policies. This will not only deprive states of a fundamental anchor of political power, but also create a challenge for the maintenance of democratic control over economic policies. Second, this article argues that soft law approaches are likely ineffective in enforcing the regulatory disciplines required to ensure economic stability.", 19 February 2013,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 16, Issue 1, March 2013, Pages 211–256, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgt003
