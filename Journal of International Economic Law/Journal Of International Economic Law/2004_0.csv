0,WTO DECISION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF PARAGRAPH 6 OF THE DOHA DECLARATION ON THE TRIPS AGREEMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: A SOLUTION TO THE ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL MEDICINES PROBLEM?,['Duncan Matthews'],The need for a legal solution to the compulsory licence problem was outlined in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health of 14 November 2001. The agreement subsequently reached by WTO Members on 30 August 2003 in response to paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration is seen as key to improving access to essential medicines in developing countries. This article re-examines the negotiations that led to the 30 August agreement and assesses its likely impact. It then argues that compulsory licensing is one of a range of policy approaches that will ultimately assist in improving access to essential medicines in developing countries. The article suggests that a long-term achievement of the Doha-based negotiations is likely to be in refocusing attention on the potential of other measures that can operate alongside compulsory licensing provisions. It concludes that the debate about the Doha Declaration and compulsory licensing is part of a much wider problem and the solution requires a mix of policy initiatives., 01 March 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 1, March 2004, Pages 73–107, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.1.73
1,THE PUZZLE OF WTO SAFEGUARDS AND REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS,['Joost Pauwelyn'],"So far WTO jurisprudence has not resolved the puzzle of how WTO Members that are part also of a regional trade agreement (such as NAFTA or MERCOSUR) should conduct safeguard investigations and apply eventual safeguards in line with WTO rules. Can or must they exclude regional imports from the injury determination? Can or must they apply the eventual safeguard only to third parties, or are they under an obligation rather to apply all safeguards on a non-discriminatory basis? Those are the questions examined in this paper. The paper refocuses some of the attention to GATT Article XIX and criticizes the Appellate Body’s requirement of parallelism as well as its jurisprudence under GATT Article XXIV. It also offers an alternative way forward and ends with a list of options for WTO safeguards by members of customs unions or free trade areas.", 01 March 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 1, March 2004, Pages 109–142, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.1.109
2,THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WTO LAW,['Jiaxiang Hu'],"As a new branch of international law, WTO law consists of the rules which particularly regulate the transactions concerning trade in goods, trade in services, investment and trade-related intellectual property rights among WTO Members. To be more specific, WTO law is referred to as the ‘single package’ results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986--1994). Basically, WTO law is no different from other branches of international law. The general principles, customary rules and the way of interpretation of international law all apply to the operation of WTO law. Notwithstanding this, WTO law still has its unique characteristics which are sufficient enough to distinguish it from other branches of international law. These differences can normally be perceived from their institutional statuses and dispute settlement mechanisms. The influence between international law and WTO law is mutual. While general international law determines the basic structure of WTO law, the creation of WTO law has also changed the landscape of international law.", 01 March 2004,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 7, Issue 1, March 2004, Pages 143–167, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/7.1.143
