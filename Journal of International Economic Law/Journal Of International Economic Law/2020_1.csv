0,The Remains of the Day: The International Economic Order in the Era of Disintegration,"['Francesco Montanaro', ' Federica Violi']","The last two decades of the XX century have been marked by a vigorous acceleration of international economic integration both at a global and regional level. States accepted pervasive constraints on their national decision-making in the hope that stability and predictability would favor economic growth. This model of international economic integration, however, has recently shown worrying signs of ‘disintegration’. Disintegration manifests itself both as disintegration of the international legal regimes which compose the international economic order; and disintegration through law, namely the social, economic and environmental disintegration phenomena, triggered or at least facilitated by these regimes. Relying on the paradox integration/disintegration as an analytical framework, this article draws a blueprint of the various disintegration phenomena, which are further analyzed in the individual contributions to this Special Issue. It seeks to identify a relationship between the two dimensions of disintegration and detect possible correlation patterns. Last, after engaging with the different normative alternatives put forward by the contributors, it concludes by calling for a rethinking of the traditional approach to international economic integration. This reconceptualization should be premised on the full realization that the current model entails a great deal of environmental and social ‘hidden costs’.", 15 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 299–322, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa018
1,International Economic Law and Disintegration: Beware the Schmittean Moment,['Alessandra Arcuri'],"In his influential book, Straight Talk on Trade, Dani Rodrik provides a cogent critique of the existing international economic order and concludes as follows: ‘So, I accept that nation-states are a source of disintegration for the global economy.’ This article critically engages with the idea that the nation-state is a legitimate force of disintegration of the international economic order, with particular attention to trade and investment agreements. In times of raising authoritarianism, it is crucial to reflect on some of the limits of the nation-state and on the necessity to develop alternative paradigms for integrating economies and societies. Against this background, this article posits that we should beware of the risk of a ‘Schmittean moment’. This term is used to refer to a major shift toward an ideal of unfettered national sovereignty as the chief paradigm to re-orient the international (economic) order. Under such ideal, any international normative benchmark is brushed away by an allegedly more intellectually honest ‘political’ dimension, which can find its realization only in the decisionist state. To understand the risk of a ‘Schmittean moment’ it is important to recognize that the move toward more nation-state is partly animated by some legitimate concerns over the existing international legal order, such as those underpinning the analysis by Dani Rodrik. This article articulates a two-fold critique of the idea that an expansion of national sovereignty is going to achieve a better socio-economic world order per se. The first critique is internal, showing that the nation-state does not possess intrinsic characteristics to facilitate democracy, equality, and sustainability. The second is external and focuses on the necessity to look reflexively at the goals of the system of international economic law, to re-imagine it as capable to address questions of inequality and environmental degradation.", 29 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 323–345, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa012
2,"Economic Disintegration? Political, Economic, and Legal Drivers and the Need for ‘Greening Embedded Trade Liberalism’",['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"This contribution uses the examples of Great Britain’s withdrawal from the EU (Brexit) and US withdrawal from multilateral trade and environmental agreements for exploring political, economic, environmental, social, and legal reasons driving the backlash against economic integration agreements. In both examples, populist battle-cries for ‘taking back control’ and for lowering regulatory standards were followed by governmental attempts at evading parliamentary control over executive foreign policy powers to violate, or withdraw from, multilateral agreements. Anglo-Saxon neo-liberalism, President Trump’s mercantilist power politics, authoritarian state-capitalism (e.g. in China), and European ordo-liberalism reflect systemic divergences that may justify broad interpretations of WTO ‘exceptions’ (e.g. for WTO trade remedies and climate change mitigation). Europe’s multilevel, democratic constitutionalism protecting ‘social market economies’ was comparatively more effective in limiting protectionism and carbon emissions inside Europe’s common market. The EU’s ‘new green deal’ for a carbon-neutral ‘green economy’ was made possible by stronger, social, and democratic support based on ‘constitutional interpretations’ of Europe’s ordo-liberalism assisting adversely affected workers, producers, traders, investors, and other citizens to adjust economic and environmental activities to climate change mitigation. EU leadership for WTO-consistent climate change rules requires ‘greening embedded liberalism’ by interpreting the WTO ‘sustainable development’ objectives in conformity with the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UN ‘sustainable development goals’, and human rights (e.g. as legal basis for climate change litigation in Europe).", 30 May 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 347–370, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa005
3,Making the WTO (Not So) Great Again: The Case Against Responding to the Trump Trade Agenda Through Reform of WTO Rules on Subsidies and State Enterprises,['Robert Howse'],"A range of WTO scholars, policy experts, and governmental officials have bought into the notion that the Trump Administration’s unilateralism and its assault on China’s trade policies and practices could and should be channeled instead into WTO reform efforts. While dealing with China through unilateral tariff hikes and more recently a bilateral phase I agreement, the notion of addressing some concerns through WTO reform has not fallen entirely on a deaf ear in the Administration. Thus, Japan and the EU have been able to engage the Administration in an initiative to revise and add new WTO rules in the areas of subsidies, state enterprises, and forced technology transfer. This article offers a critical assessment of this initiative, arguing that by and large the proposed changes will add incoherence to existing WTO rules and make it more difficult for WTO Members to engage in economic and industrial policies that are needed, for example, to the address the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.", 30 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 371–389, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa017
4,Integration and Disintegration: Trade and Labor Market Integration,['Margaret E Peters'],"After World War II, the victors—the USA and the UK—created a liberal international order (LIO) based on integrating markets for goods and capital but not labor. The decision to remove barriers to trade in goods and capital flows have had profound effects on immigration. Trade has meant the closure of businesses in developed countries that rely on low-skill labor. When these firms closed, they took their support for low-skill immigration with them. The ability of capital to move intensified this trend: whereas once firms needed to bring labor to their capital, they can now take their capital to labor. Once these firms move, they have little incentive to fight for immigration at home. Finally, increased productivity, as both a product of and response to globalization, has meant that firms can do more with fewer workers, again decreasing demands for immigration. Together, these changes have led to less business support for immigration, allowing politicians to move to the right on immigration and pass restrictions to appease anti-immigration forces. The recent backlash to the LIO, then, has implicated the very flow—the movement of labor—that was never part of it.", 22 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 391–412, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa007
5,Disintegration and Change in the International Law on Foreign Investment,['Muthucumaraswamy Sornarajah'],"Resistance to the law made through expansionist interpretation of investment treaties by arbitral tribunals has led to the disintegration of the resulting structure of investment protection. The creation of an inflexible system of investment protection through arbitral interpretation undermines the exercise of power of states to take measures to protect the public interest. The process of disintegration of this unjust system must be hastened through the creation of new norms that ensure that obligatory rules deter the misconduct of multinational investors. If investment treaties are necessary, the regulatory power of states to promote the public interest should be given priority over investment protection.", 29 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 413–429, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa014
6,"(Dis)integration in Global Resource Governance: Extractivism, Human Rights, and Investment Treaties",['Lorenzo Cotula'],"As global material consumption rests on the large-scale production of commodities for food, energy, and raw materials, the governance of natural resources—from national legislation to international trade, investment, and human rights law—has long provided policy arenas for deepening economic integration. Concerns about ‘resource nationalism’ and critiques of investor–state dispute settlement have raised questions as to whether the world might be entering a phase of economic dis-integration. To problematize linear accounts of (dis)integration, this article explores the legal arrangements that integrate resource-dependent countries into the global economy. It argues that natural resource extraction is facilitated by a legal regime that sustains dis-integration patterns in global resource governance—including relations between state-based and traditional governance systems; between extractive enclaves and national territories; and between different spheres of international regulation. Some of the recent contestation, then, reflects efforts to (re)integrate dis-integrated legal and social realities, by more fully recognizing local systems of practice and belief and more effectively considering human rights in investment processes.", 24 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 431–454, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa003
7,"International Investment Agreements, Human Rights, and Environmental Justice: The Texaco/Chevron Case From the Ecuadorian Amazon","['Lorenzo Pellegrini', ' Murat Arsel', ' Martí Orta-Martínez', ' Carlos F Mena']","The Texaco/Chevron lawsuit, which started in November 1993 and is still being litigated in 2020, is a prominent example of the process of judicialization of environmental conflict. The Ecuadorian plaintiffs claim that the oil company’s operations generated ruinous impacts on the environment and on the development prospects and health of nearby individuals and communities. The tortuous and lengthy judiciary process was further hindered by an arbitration process, an Investor–State Dispute Settlement mechanism nested in the Ecuador—United States Bilateral Investment Treaty. The significance of the case goes beyond the specifics of Ecuador and provides further arguments fuelling the protracted legitimacy crisis experienced by International Investment Agreements. The current praxis of Investor–State Dispute Settlement mechanisms is generating an asymmetrical system, protecting the interest of investors, and intruding into the space of human and environmental rights. These issues are resonating with social movements, activist scholars and policy makers who are reacting to the vulnerabilities engendered by International Investment Agreements through multipronged strategies. These asymmetries provide ammunition to resist the signing of new International Investment Agreements, support the inclusion of human and environmental rights safeguards in International Investment Agreements, and contribute to the rationale of pre-empting extractive projects that are likely to produce severe environmental liabilities. Some of the potential ways in which a somewhat more level playing field can be created include, in addition to denouncing investment agreements, transforming Investor–State Dispute Settlement mechanisms towards a format that can also accommodate the complaints of affected communities or enacting moratoria on extraction projects that are prone to adverse socioenvironmental impacts. Both strategies could prove to be productive avenues towards the achievement of justice.", 30 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 455–468, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa016
8,From Monetary to Fiscal to Political Union: A Progression to Integration or a Recipe for Failure?,['Massimo D’Antoni'],"In this paper, we discuss the limits of the architecture of the euro from an economic point of view. We first highlight how the choice to create a monetary union was not supported by the accepted theory of optimal currency areas, and how its institutional set-up responded to a special and questionable view of the functioning of the economy, which recognized only a limited role to active macroeconomic policies. We continue by reconstructing the reasons for the emergence of the 2010–2011 debt crisis that can be traced back to the dynamics triggered by the single currency itself, and we highlight the role played by structural differences between various models of capitalism. Finally, we argue that the proposals currently on the table are by no means sufficient to correct the flaws in the European monetary architecture. The prospects are therefore pessimistic about the possibility of monetary union evolving towards a fiscal and political union.", 22 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 469–488, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa009
9,"Differentiated Integration and Disintegration in the EU: Brexit, the Eurozone Crisis, and Other Troubles",['Menelaos Markakis'],"This article looks at theories of differentiated integration and disintegration in the wake of the Eurozone crisis and the Brexit referendum. It advances four distinct, albeit interrelated, arguments with respect to these proposals. First, it could be contested whether certain policy areas should be pushed to the ‘outer core’ of European integration. Second, it would be very difficult to disentangle those areas to be pushed to the ‘outer core’ from those areas remaining in the ‘inner core’. Third, the legal and institutional arrangements for organizing differentiated integration are equally important. Fourth, even if the problems adumbrated above could be addressed satisfactorily, the emerging arrangements for differentiated integration would differ little from the degree of flexibility or variation that already exists within some of those areas. Brexit may be viewed as an opportunity for reform to ‘fix’ those issues that are regarded as problematic in the design or functioning of the EU. Should it appear desirable to pursue differentiated integration, the better course of action would be to build on those opportunities for differentiated integration that are offered by the EU Treaties. Any forthcoming Treaty revision to take stock of Brexit could be used to give added impetus to differentiated integration.", 30 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 489–507, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa004
10,Money Laundering and Central Bank Governance in The European Union,"['Panicos Demetriades', ' Radosveta Vassileva']","Dirty money is often a by-product or a symptom of political corruption in the jurisdictions in which it originates. It can also spread corruption and erode democracy on its journey to its final destination. This typically involves multiple jurisdictions and is the reason why it is so hard to detect. Recently, a series of money laundering scandals have highlighted weaknesses in the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) framework of the European Union (EU), the implementation of which remains the responsibility of Member States. The paper argues that EU’s defences against money laundering have been weakened partly reflecting a little-known erosion in the independence of Member State central banks, which are often the AML supervisors. It puts forward a number of new proposals to strengthen the governance and AML/CFT implementation in the EU.", 08 July 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 23, Issue 2, June 2020, Pages 509–533, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa011
