0,Reviewing the GPA: The Role and Development of the Plurilateral Agreement After Doha,['Sue Arrowsmith'],"The plurilateral Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) is currently undergoing a review, the first phase of which seeks to simplify and improve the GPA text. This article sets out proposals for achieving these objectives of simplification and improvement. It argues that, despite recent multilateral initiatives, the GPA will remain the WTO's most important instrument on government procurement, and that attracting new members is thus an important perspective for the review. Further, many of the reforms that could attract new members are also necessary to ensure an appropriate balance between free trade rules and domestic sovereignty.", 01 December 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 4, December 2002, Pages 761–790, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.4.761
1,Trade‐Related Labor and Environment Agreements?,['Chantal Thomas'],"Labor and environment standards resemble intellectual property standards in terms of their relationship to trade flows and their international legal status. Despite these similarities, only intellectual property standards have been incorporated into the WTO. Once conventional defenses for excluding labor and environment standards from the WTO are cleared away, more genuine issues of political will and orientation emerge. If these political problems were resolved, however, real difficulties of legal form would arise – the coherence and content of labor and environment obligations, and other justiciability concerns. However, a comparison to similar challenges within trade and intellectual property law suggests that such difficulties can be overcome, if it is deemed desirable to do so.", 01 December 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 4, December 2002, Pages 791–819, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.4.791
2,WTO Deference to National Health Policy: Toward an Interpretive Principle,['M. Gregg Bloche'],"Critics of the WTO often cast it as an obstacle to human health, particularly in the poorest nations. Not only does this portrayal overlook potential synergies between trade and health; it all but ignores recent developments within the WTO that have affirmed member states' power to promote health. The WTO's framers paid little heed to health policy. Over the past few years, however, politics and the AIDS pandemic have pushed health to center stage as a trade issue. This article reviews the WTO's response. It considers the WTO's treatment of national health policies in several contexts – GATT Art. XX(b) (permitting health regulations that restrict trade), the SPS Agreement (governing food safety regulation), and the TRIPS Agreement (limiting manufacture and sale of patent‐protected medicines). It identifies an emerging pattern of heightened deference to national authority when member states' health policies conflict with other values protected by trade agreements. The WTO system, I argue, has come to treat protection for health as a de facto interpretive principle when disputes arise over members' treaty obligations. But rather than imposing a one‐size‐fits‐all conception of rational health policy, WTO decision‐makers have preferred the path of deference to members' varied policy choices. This approach sensibly accommodates the psychology of health politics, differences in culture and resources among member states, and hopes for recognition of health as a value in international law.", 01 December 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 4, December 2002, Pages 825–848, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.4.825
3,"Patents, Innovation and Access to New Pharmaceuticals",['Henry Grabowski'],"This paper considers the role of intellectual property rights in the development of, and access to, new pharmaceuticals. A number of studies have found patents are significantly more important to pharmaceutical firms in appropriating the benefits from innovation compared with other high tech industries. The reason for this is because the costs of drug innovation are very high while the costs of imitation are relatively low. Hence the industry is subject to significant free‐rider problems. The paper discusses the economics of the innovative process and considers how patent policies have evolved in response to these characteristics in several developed countries with research‐intensive drug firms. One area currently receiving policy attention is the effect of patents on the development of, and access to, new medicines for developing countries. The final section of the paper focuses on this issue and discusses the need for an orphan drug type programme to stimulate more R&D on diseases specific to third‐world countries.", 01 December 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 4, December 2002, Pages 849–860, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.4.849
4,The Human Rights Implications of Intellectual Property Protection,['Audrey R. Chapman'],"A variety of human rights organizations and agencies have begun to realize that the manner in which creative works, cultural heritage, and scientific knowledge are turned into property has implications for human rights. These concerns have led to a series of initiatives by United Nations human rights institutions, the most significant of which is the November 2001 statement on ‘Human Rights and Intellectual Property Issues’ adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Its central theme is that intellectual property protection and international trade regulation must respect and abide by international human rights law. This article outlines the provisions of a human rights perspective on the requirements for intellectual property and then discusses its potential conflicts with current developments in intellectual property law.", 01 December 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 4, December 2002, Pages 861–882, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.4.861
5,"Differential Pricing of Essential AIDS Drugs: Markets, Politics and Public Health",['Peter J. Hammer'],"Differential pricing of essential drugs is an intuitively obvious component of any comprehensive response to the AIDS crisis. Constructing an effective regime of price discrimination between first and third world pharmaceutical markets, however, raises complicated economic, legal and political challenges. Low‐priced drugs in developing countries could trigger forms of physical and informational arbitrage that could undermine prices and profits in lucrative first world markets. Furthermore, the pricing of AIDS drugs highlights legal tensions between public health concerns and private intellectual property rights under the WTO TRIPS agreement. This essay explores these issues and examines how classic economic models of price discrimination can afford a political framework to mediate first‐ and third‐world tensions over essential drugs, providing a template that can maintain the integrity of intellectual property rights while respecting humanitarian concerns over access to life‐saving drugs.", 01 December 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 4, December 2002, Pages 883–912, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.4.883
6,Post‐TRIPS Options for Access to Patented Medicines in Developing Nations,"['F. M. Scherer', ' Jayashree Watal']","This article explores the tension between granting patent protection under the TRIPS Agreements and the availability of medicines at affordable prices to developing countries. A crucial consideration under the TRIPS compulsory licensing option is the ‘adequate remuneration’ paid. A theoretical and empirical analysis shows that the royalties set under past compulsory licenses have been much lower than those that would be established under the ‘foregone profits’ standard of US patent law. To respect comparative advantage in the supply of licensed drugs, the TRIPS language requiring that compulsory licensing be predominantly for domestic supply needs clarification. The multinational drug pricing strategy that best combines equity with coverage of R&D costs is a variant of Ramsey pricing, under which prices are much lower in nations with low ability to pay and/or high price elasticities of demand than in wealthy nations. Statistical evidence on the prices of 15 AIDS drugs in 18 low‐ and medium‐income nations reveals that tendencies toward Ramsey pricing were at best weak. To encourage Ramsey pricing, parallel exports should be barred from low‐income nations, and price controls should not benchmark the prices charged in low‐income nations. Outright donation can also enhance the supply of drugs to low‐income nations. A quantitative analysis shows that when the marginal cost of production is low relative to ‘inventoriable’ average cost, donations can actually enhance a drug producer's after‐tax profits under US tax laws. Minor tax law changes to enhance donation incentives are suggested.", 01 December 2002,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 5, Issue 4, December 2002, Pages 913–939, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/5.4.913
