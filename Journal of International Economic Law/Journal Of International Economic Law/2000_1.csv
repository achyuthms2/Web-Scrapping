0,Federalism and regulation: extrapolating from the analysis of environmental regulation in the United States,['RL Revesz'],"This article extends the author's prior work concerning how responsibility over environmental regulation in the United States should be allocated between the federal government and the states. It shows why the structure of the environmental regulation in the European Union is poorly suited for the control of interstate externalities, and exposes the weaknesses of arguments for the European Union's harmonization of process standards. It then explains that in the international community the arguments differ in large part because of the weak capacity for centralized environmental standard-setting. Trade measures can therefore be a desirable way of combatting overly lax process standards in exporting countries that lead to interjurisdictional spillovers. But such trade measures should not be permitted merely because the exporting country has less stringent environmental standards than the importing country. The article ends with an analysis of how race-to-the-bottom arguments in different regulatory contexts deal with analytically distinct phenomena.", 01 June 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2000, Pages 219–233, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.2.219
1,Regulatory co-opetition,"['DC Esty', ' D Geradin']","Regulatory reformers in the United States call for decentralization in the name of 'federalism'. In Europe, a similar sentiment advances under the banner of 'subsidiarity'. One of the underlying and critical theoretical premises of these two movements is the suggestion that 'regulatory competition' among horizontally arrayed governments will generate pressures for improved governmental efficiency in the regulatory realm. Critics have suggested that rather than welfare-enhancing competitive pressures, divergent regulatory standards may instead trigger a welfare-reducing 'race toward the bottom'. In this article we argue that both race-toward-the-bottom and regulatory competition theories are overstated from a descriptive point of view and unsatisfactory from a normative perspective. Regulatory theory must reflect the diversity and complexity of the world. Optimal governance thus requires a flexible mix of competition and cooperation between government actors as well as between governmental and non-governmental actors, along both horizontal and vertical dimensions. This enriched model of 'regulatory co-opetition' recognizes that sometimes regulatory competition will prove to be advantageous but in other cases some form of collaboration will produce superior results. In a world that is pluralistic, not simplistic, a combination of regulatory competition and cooperation will almost always be optimal.", 01 June 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2000, Pages 235–255, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.2.235
2,Regulatory competition or regulatory harmonization? A silly question?,['AO Sykes'],"The debate over 'competition versus harmonization' in regulatory policy often confuses the pertinent alternatives. This comment argues that neither pure regulatory competition nor complete regulatory harmonization is desirable or feasible where important international cross-border effects of regulation arise. Instead, a considerable degree of cooperation is almost always needed, yet non-homogeneity of regulatory policies is almost always desirable as well. This proposition holds virtually regardless of the subject matter of regulation.", 01 June 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2000, Pages 257–264, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.2.257
3,Environmental regulation and economic integration,['D Vogel'],"This article explores the relationship between economic integration and environmental regulation. It begins by observing that fears that economic competition would lead to a regulatory 'race toward the bottom' appear to have proven unwarranted: increased economic integration has proven compatible with the general strengthening of environmental standards. It then explains why economic interdependence has not led sub-national, national, and regional governments to compete by lowering their environmental standards. The article then explores various mechanisms by which economic integration has contributed to the strengthening of regulatory standards. It concludes by discussing the shortcomings of existing mechanisms of global environmental governance and specifying the circumstances under which regulatory coordination can promote more effective environmental governance.", 01 June 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2000, Pages 265–279, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.2.265
4,Regulatory competition and the global coordination of labor standards,['D Charny'],"This paper develops a framework for analyzing regulatory competition in labor standards. Labor standards are categorized into 'rule-types', and it is shown that different rule-types are affected differently by interjurisdictional competition for trade or investment. In particular, 'purely efficient' rules are likely to be unaffected by interjurisdictional competition, while interjurisdictional competition may exert substantial pressure on rules with distributive impacts. The paper then turns to the political implications of this analysis. Conceptions of 'rights' are largely inapt to the analysis of interjurisdictional competition; but democratic theory, as well as a commitment to global equity, may call for the development of trans-national institutions which would coordinate the setting of labor standards in order to mitigate the effects of interjurisdictional competition. The paper concludes by identifying problems in the design of these trans-national labor institutions.", 01 June 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2000, Pages 281–302, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.2.281
5,Labor federalism in the United States: lessons for international labor rights,['M Barenberg'],"Before the 1960s, United States regulatory institutions effectively enforced the principle that interstate commerce in goods produced in violation of workers' rights of association is an unfair trade practice. Thereafter, the same institutions facilitated the de facto non-enforcement of those core labor rights. This experience is best understood through regulatory models of 'coordinated decentralization'. The experience of United States labor federalism points to several institutional features that are likely to prove critical to the success or failure of any supranational architecture for enforcement of international labor rights, including: the regulatory endogeneity of interest groups; the structure of non-governmental institutions that span the tiers of federal public institutions; the mechanisms that mutually reinforce procedural and substantive rights of association; and the public-private networks that seek economic growth through agglomeration of human physical capital or, instead, through minimization of unit labor costs.", 01 June 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2000, Pages 303–329, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.2.303
6,Regulatory competition and regulatory jurisdiction,['JP Trachtman'],"This article seeks to assess the limits of competition, and the need for regulation of competition, among regulatory jurisdictions. The market for regulation involves competition among states, and may be regulated by supra-state law, including international law generated by international institutions, such as the WTO or the EU. The question of how competition among states should be regulated is analogous to the question asked often in domestic policy debates: how should competition among firms be regulated? This article looks to the theory of property law and, to a lesser extent, competition law, as well as to the Tiebout model, to suggest answers. This article argues that it is impossible to generalize about the benefits of competition in regulation, and that a number of factors must be considered. These factors cannot be simply totted up by a researcher who then provides definitive policy advice. First, the regulatory competition model, like all models, has particular parameters that must be met in order for it to apply. These parameters cannot be assumed, but must be evaluated in particular cases. Second, the parameters are never completely met, placing us in the realm of the theory of the second best. The realm of the theory of the second best calls for legislative deliberation rather than judicial or scholarly determination. Third, these factors are incommensurable and involve interpersonal comparison of utility. Therefore, again, the design of regulatory competition, like other decisions about regulation, is best left for political determination, informed by scholarly analyses of these factors.", 01 June 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2000, Pages 331–348, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.2.331
7,Regulatory competition for EU financial services,['G Hertig'],"The practical impact of EU regulatory efforts to facilitate cross-border financial services has yet to become clear. This may reflect either lingering Member State protectionism or simply the time needed for regulatory reform to become effective. The fact that EU harmonization has resulted in the adoption of minimum standards that cannot considered high in relative terms supports the latter explanation. Market access has been facilitated and there is room for regulatory competition - especially when Euro and e-commerce developments are taken into account. However, in the end, the growth of cross-border financial services will depend upon the perceived effectiveness of home Member State supervision. Given that modern financial supervision requires regulatory agencies to successfully hire and retain a large number of specialists, both providers of financial services and regulators seem willing to sacrifice some regulatory diversity in favor of centralized EU supervision.", 01 June 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2000, Pages 349–375, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.2.349
8,The trade-labor nexus: developing countries' perspectives,['JM Salazar-Xirinachs'],The Seattle Ministerial Meeting highlighted the diverging positions of industrialized and developing countries on trade and labor. This note describes and analyzes the main arguments of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries regarding the inclusion of labor issues in the WTO negotiations. The author draws on his experience as Trade Minister of Costa Rica and participant in numerous diplomatic discussions on the subject of this note., 01 June 2000,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2000, Pages 377–385, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/3.2.377
