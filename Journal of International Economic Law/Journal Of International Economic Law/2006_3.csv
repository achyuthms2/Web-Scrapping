0,From Progressive Liberalization to Progressive Regulation in WTO Law,['Thomas Cottier'],"This paper addresses conceptual problems of special and differential (S&D) treatment of developing countries (DCs). Observing that past and present avenues have largely failed, it suggests the concept of progressive regulation in the field of prescriptive rules. Based on the idea of progressive liberalization, it develops a new concept of graduation inherent to substantive rules and suggests taking recourse to individual scheduling of commitments. Learning from the idea of progressive liberalization, commensurate to diverging levels of development, it is submitted that graduation, based on recourse to economic factors within substantive rules, and scheduling of additional commitments could replace traditional perceptions of S&D treatment and render World Trade Organization (WTO) more responsive to the needs of developing Member States of the WTO. As an example, this paper applies these concepts to the problem of patenting pharmaceutical products.", 03 November 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 4, December 2006, Pages 779–821, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl029
1,Rulemaking Amidst Growing Diversity: A Club-of-Clubs Approach to WTO Reform and New Issue Selection,['Robert Z. Lawrence'],"The diverse nature of World Trade Organization (WTO) membership makes it highly unlikely that members will all be willing and able to sign on to the full range of agreements that many members might find desirable. The paper proposes an approach in which the WTO would supplement its core agreements with additional ‘clubs’ to which only some members would subscribe. The approach is a compromise in which diversity can co-exist with a more extensive set of commitments for willing members. The paper provides suggestions for how the clubs would be selected and how they would operate. Clubs would be chosen where they could help promote the WTO’s central missions: lowering barriers to trade, reducing the discriminatory effects of domestic policies, and enhancing economic development through trade. All WTO members would participate in negotiating club rules, but members would be free not to join. Clubs would use the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) to deal with disputes, but suspension of concessions in the event of violations would be confined to the provisions of the same club in which the violation occurred.", 03 November 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 4, December 2006, Pages 823–835, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl032
2,The Consistency of WTO Rules: Can the Single Undertaking Be Squared with Variable Geometry?,"['Craig VanGrasstek', ' Pierre Sauvé']","The diversity of countries that negotiate commitments in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the distinctions between their legal and constitutional systems, implies important differences in how agreements are approved, implemented, and enforced. Although consistency is among the desirable attributes to which the multilateral trading system should strive, it cannot be achieved at the expense of all other desiderata. Among the reasons for relaxation of this goal is the need to accommodate the different legal systems and levels of economic development among Member States, as well as the demands for flexibility in negotiations. This paper reviews the development and current status of the debate over consistency in the multilateral system, with special emphasis on the perspectives of three different sets of participants: the United States, the European Union (EU), and developing countries. In the trade-off between the depth and the width of the trading system, the paper asks whether WTO Members should be more interested in expanding the scope of globally agreed rules or in securing countries’ adherence to them? It explores the possible consequences for the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) if the US Congress cannot be convinced to make a new grant of trade promotion authority (TPA) after the current one expires. It also discusses whether the single undertaking should continue to shape the terms of the DDA. In discussing the WTO’s approach to decision-making and the possible need for reforms thereto, the paper also considers how best and on what grounds should new issues be introduced on the negotiating agenda. The paper argues that whether or not the DDA is conducted on the basis of a single undertaking, and with or without TPA, the multilateral trading system will continue to provide for less than full consistency.", 03 November 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 4, December 2006, Pages 837–864, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl031
3,Services Negotiations in the Doha Round: Lost in Flexibility?,['Rudolf Adlung'],"The World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for services trade, under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), are far broader in policy coverage than their counterpart provisions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), reflecting, inter alia, the Agreement’s extension to cross-border movements of services consumers and factors of production. At the same time, the GATS is significantly more flexible in application than the GATT. There are virtually no political sensitivities, protectionist or not, that could not be formally accommodated within its structure. Moreover, the paucity of relevant jurisprudence on key concepts and a yet incomplete rule-making agenda have provided additional scope for ‘creative’ interpretation. However, while flexibility was a sine qua non for the conclusion of the Agreement, given the diversity of institutional conditions, political concerns, and so on among participants, it has not been conducive to one of the key objectives: ‘early achievement of progressively higher levels of liberalization’. This article discusses possible approaches that, within the Agreement’s current structure, could promote the clarity, quantity, and commercial relevance of services commitments and address remaining rule-making issues. However, there is no panacea. The challenge remains to find a reasonable balance between economically meaningful disciplines and their broad application across sectors, modes of supply, and WTO Members.", 10 October 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 4, December 2006, Pages 865–893, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl027
4,The Lack of Dissent in WTO Dispute Settlement,['Meredith Kolsky Lewis'],"This article analyses in detail the fact that there has been almost no dissent in World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement reports. Only a handful of articles have noted this phenomenon, even in passing. The article first examines the empirical data with respect to dissenting and concurring opinions at both the panel and Appellate Body levels. Fewer than 5% of panel reports and 2% of Appellate Body reports contain separate opinions of any kind. Second, it shows that the WTO is in fact actively discouraging dissents and discusses why this might be the case. The article argues that dissents are valuable in general and assesses whether more dissents would be a positive for the WTO. It then reviews the few dissents that have been published and demonstrates that 50% of the arguments raised in dissents at the panel level were adopted in whole or in part on appeal by the Appellate Body, thus illustrating dissents can and do make a difference. The article concludes that keeping the lid on dissents may ultimately erode the strength of the dispute settlement system and hinder the ability of the WTO Members to make appropriate changes to the Agreements.", 25 September 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 4, December 2006, Pages 895–931, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl025
5,Completing the Analysis in WTO Appeals: The Practice and its Limitations,"['Alan Yanovich', ' Tania Voon']","Since its creation in 1995, the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has gradually constructed a consistent approach to completing panels’ analysis where the circumstances permit. The need for this practice stems from the limitation of WTO appeals to issues of law and the absence of remand in WTO disputes. The Appellate Body can be seen to complete a panel’s analysis in two different scenarios: to deal with a claim that the panel failed to address; or to apply a different legal interpretation to the facts of the case, where the Appellate Body has reversed or modified the panel’s legal interpretation. In deciding whether to complete a panel’s analysis, the Appellate Body appears to consider three criteria: the existence of uncontested facts to resolve the matter, the connection between the legal issues to be addressed in completing the analysis and those considered by the panel, and the due process rights of the parties to the dispute. Where these criteria are not satisfied, the Appellate Body is unable to complete the analysis, and the dispute may go unresolved. This is an increasing problem, highlighting the need for WTO Members to agree on a suitable remand mechanism.", 20 September 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 4, December 2006, Pages 933–950, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl024
6,"What Are Trade Agreements For? – Two Conflicting Stories Told by Economists, With a Lesson for Lawyers",['Donald H. Regan'],"Economists tell two stories about the function of trade agreements: trade agreements restrain protectionism, or trade agreements restrain the purposeful exploitation of market power, which I call ‘terms-of-trade manipulation’. These stories are distinct, because protectionism and terms-of-trade manipulation are distinct, although they are often confused. Logically, trade agreements might restrain both protectionism and terms-of-trade manipulation, but no one holds this view. Protectionism theorists think terms-of-trade manipulation is rare in the real world; terms-of-trade theorists adopt a theoretical perspective in which they prove protectionism is globally efficient and should not be restrained. I analyse the two stories to dispel common conceptual confusions. I show that the protectionism story is superior, empirically and theoretically: countries do not exploit their market power, and the theoretical perspective of the terms-of-trade story is wrong if our concern is to interpret agreements. I reinterpret a theorem from the terms-of-trade story, and combine it with the fact that countries do not exploit market power, to demonstrate that national regulation that is domestically rational (except for not exploiting market power) is globally efficient and hence should not be restrained. This grounds a novel, efficiency-based argument against ‘balancing’ by dispute tribunals and in favour of substantial deference to non-protectionist regulation.", 17 November 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 4, December 2006, Pages 951–988, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl034
7,Giving Legal Effect to the Results of WTO Trade Negotiations: An Analysis of the Methods of Changing WTO Law,"['Hunter Nottage', ' Thomas Sebastian']","Trade negotiations conducted in the World Trade Organization (WTO) offer the significant benefit that their results can be made legally binding and enforceable through an effective dispute settlement system. If negotiators wish to avail of this benefit, they must follow the correct procedures to give legal effect to their work. This article critically evaluates the main methods of converting the results of WTO trade negotiations, with a particular focus on the ongoing Doha Round, into WTO law. It demonstrates that amendments to the WTO agreements are procedurally cumbersome and have significant limitations. The article therefore analyses several alternative methods including modifications to schedules, decisions of the Ministerial Conference (such as waivers, authoritative interpretations, and Other Decisions), and the incorporation of new agreements into WTO law (whether multilateral, plurilateral, or reference rules accepted through schedules). The choice between these various methods is complicated as each has advantages and disadvantages. By comparing and evaluating the available options, this article aims to assist negotiators and lawyers in making that difficult choice.", 12 October 2006,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 9, Issue 4, December 2006, Pages 989–1016, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgl028
