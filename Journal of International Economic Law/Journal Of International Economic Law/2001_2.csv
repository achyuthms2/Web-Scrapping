0,Proportionality in WTO Law,['Axel Desmedt'],"In many legal systems, the proportionality principle is an important tool for judges to check the regulatory freedom of governments. In EC law, for example, the proportionality principle is one of the most important unwritten principles commonly invoked before the European Court of Justice in challenging EU legislation. Likewise, the proportionality principle could also play a significant role in WTO law when judging regulations of WTO Members. This article analyses the status of this principle in WTO law, looking at three different areas of WTO law where proportionality requirements have been explored: countermeasures, the TBT and SPS Agreements, and Article XX of GATT. The experience in these three areas shows that the proportionality principle has not yet been recognized as an unwritten principle of WTO law. Rather, requirements of proportionality depend on the actual language found in the text of the relevant provisions. Sometimes more specific provisions will limit the proportionality principle's relevance as is the case for countermeasures. In other cases, obligations that could result from a hypothetical overarching WTO proportionality principle are specifically provided in the text of the agreements. However, depending on the language of the provision at stake, the implications of the proportionality requirements will differ. In sum, there is not one single overarching (unwritten) proportionality principle in WTO law. Furthermore, this article submits that at this stage of the WTO's development, it would not be appropriate for the WTO dispute settlement organs to assert such a principle.", 01 September 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 3, 1 September 2001, Pages 441–480, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.3.441
1,Moving the Trade and Competition Debate Forward,"['Ignacio Garcia Bercero', ' Stefan D. Amarasinha']","The present article argues that anti‐competitive practices, which distort international trade, require a multilateral response. Traditional unilateral and bilateral responses fall short when faced with such anti‐competitive practices. Competition‐related provisions are already contained in a number of WTO agreements such as TRIPs and GATS, but there is a need for a more systematic treatment of the issue of competition in the WTO. The solution could be negotiations on a WTO competition agreement, which would be based on the fundamental principles of non‐discrimination and transparency. The agreement would also establish the necessary modalities for multilateral cooperation thereby also giving developing countries access to such cooperation. Finally, the agreement and the Competition Policy Committee, which could be established to administer such an agreement, would play an important catalytic role in promoting the reinforcement of competition institutions.", 01 September 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 3, 1 September 2001, Pages 481–506, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.3.481
2,"High Noon: We Need New Approaches to Global Problem‐Solving, Fast",['Jean‐François Rischard'],"What are we doing about planetary problems, such as global warming, the fight against illegal drugs, and new communicable diseases? Not enough. Why? Because we're not doing enough to tackle the real problem: global issues management. This essay begins by identifying two exponential forces – the demographic explosion and the new economy – which are creating a dangerous ‘governance gap’ between global issues and the capacity of traditional institutions to solve them. It proposes a tentative list of the 20 most urgent global issues for the next 20 years and suggests how we might go about solving them. In particular, it discusses the pros and cons of a new concept of global issues networks, each dealing with one of the 20 big issues, and suggests that such networks are a real possibility for better and faster global problem‐solving.", 01 September 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 3, 1 September 2001, Pages 507–525, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.3.507
3,EC Commercial Defence Actions against Textiles from 1995 to 2000: Possible Lessons for Future Negotiations,"['Edwin Vermulst', ' Polya Mihaylova']","This article explores, on the basis of a case study of anti‐dumping and countervailing duty actions taken by the European Union against textiles products from 1995 to 2000, whether proposed changes to the WTO Anti‐Dumping Agreement and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures in the period immediately preceding the Seattle Ministerial would have a significant effect in practice, particularly to the benefit of developing countries. The article concludes that this would not necessarily be the case, and offers additional suggestions for amendments that would affect almost all cases.", 01 September 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 3, 1 September 2001, Pages 527–555, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.3.527
4,Do Different Treaty Purposes Matter for Treaty Interpretation? The Elimination of Discriminatory Internal Taxes in EC and WTO Law,['Marco M. Slotboom'],"The comparison made in this contribution between Article III:2 GATT and Article 90 EC indicates that different treaty purposes need not matter that much, if the text and purpose of individual provisions are similar. Indeed, the different objectives and purposes of the GATT and the EC have not led to noticeably different interpretations of the similarly worded obligations on WTO Members and EC Member States concerning the elimination of discriminatory internal taxes in Article III:2 GATT and Article 90 EC. This finding is in line with Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties, which puts emphasis on the relevance of the wording of treaty provisions. The European Court of Justice (ECJ), however, pays more attention to the object and purpose of the EC Treaty when interpreting a provision of that treaty. Would one have followed the line of reasoning of the ECJ, one might therefore have expected another conclusion.", 01 September 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 3, 1 September 2001, Pages 557–579, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.3.557
5,The Saga Continues: An Update on the Banana Dispute and Its Procedural Offspring,"['John H. Jackson', ' Patricio Grane']","The regulation adopted by the European Commission on 2 May 2001 may herald the end of the long‐standing banana dispute. In its wake, the saga has left a long trail of panels, arbitration, and procedural battles. This article completes the ‘roadmap’ of the banana dispute and its progeny, by reporting on the following distinct matters: (i) US – Section 301–310 of the Trade Act of 1974; (ii) US – Import Measures on Certain Products from the EC; (iii) Ecuador – Recourse to Article 22.2 and 22.7 of the DSU (authorization to suspend concessions); (iv) Section 306 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by Section 407 of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (carousel provision). It also provides a table that lists all the disputes that have been initiated since 1993 and that are related to the banana dispute.", 01 September 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 3, 1 September 2001, Pages 581–595, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.3.581
6,The Latest on Indirect Effect of WTO Law in the EC Legal Order: The Nakajima Case Law Misjudged?,['Geert A. Zonnekeyn'],"CASE NOTE ON THREE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE IN THE INTERNAL EC BANANA BATTLE
The judgments of the Court of First Instance (‘CFI’) in the banana cases of 20 March 2001 have shed some light on how the CF or the Court of Justice interpret the Nakajima line of case law, pursuant to which WTO law can serve as grounds for review in cases where the EC intends to implement a particular WTO obligation. The narrow interpretation given by the CFI to the ‘Nakajima doctrine’ will make it very difficult to review the legality of EC law in the light of the obligations of the EC under WTO law.", 01 September 2001,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 4, Issue 3, 1 September 2001, Pages 597–608, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/4.3.597
