0,Governance Indicators in the Law of Development Finance: A Legal Analysis of the World Bank’s ‘Country Policy and Institutional Assessment’,['Michael Riegner'],"The article presents a legal critique of and a legal framework for the ‘Country Policy and Institutional Assessment’ (CPIA), the indicator system used by the World Bank to evaluate the governance performance of its borrowers and to allocate aid to its poorest members. The CPIA is becoming increasingly rules-based and raises important questions for legal research: First, what legal role does the CPIA play in the allocation of public resources by the World Bank, and how can the CPIA’s financial, reputational, and cognitive effects be conceptualized from a legal point of view? Secondly, what is the existing legal framework for influential governance rating exercises like the CPIA, and should this framework be developed further along the lines of Global Administrative Law or ‘public’ law thinking? And finally, what is the appropriate role of ‘technocratic’ instruments such as indicators in global (re)distribution of financial resources?
The main argument is that the CPIA is a promising tool to make development more effective, but that it also represents a powerful exercise of international public authority which requires an appropriate public law framework. This framework already exists in part within the administrative law of development cooperation, which enables us to transform certain concerns about the CPIA’s effectiveness and legitimacy into legal arguments. However, this framework remains deficient and must be further developed, for which the article makes some concrete suggestions.
The article proceeds in three main steps: It first develops an analytical and regulatory framework for indicators used in development cooperation. It then applies this framework to the CPIA, analysing its genealogy, contents, and effects, as well as existing mechanisms of participation, reason-giving, transparency, and review. The third section evaluates the CPIA’s existing legal regime against the principles of development cooperation law, namely development-orientation and efficacy as well as collective and individual autonomy. The conclusion reflects on how this framework potentially captures the tensions between distributive politics and expert-driven, technocratic instruments like indicators.", 08 March 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 1, March 2016, Pages 1–26, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw002
1,"Protecting Regulatory Autonomy through Greater Precision in Investment Treaties: The TPP, CETA, and TTIP",['Caroline Henckels'],"The recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the negotiations underway for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have drawn renewed attention to the potential for treaty parties to frame the substantive obligations in new investment treaties in a manner that is more supportive of regulatory autonomy than earlier treaties. One way of doing so is to more precisely define the contours of states’ obligations towards foreign investors and investments, in an attempt to eliminate the likelihood of successful challenges to non-discriminatory public welfare measures. More precise norms place greater constraints on the decision-making criteria employed by adjudicators, fettering their discretion to make evaluative judgments. Treaty parties may adopt more precise language to provide guidance or to exert control over adjudicators in light of previous decisions that are regarded as erroneous, in light of concerns about adjudicator incompetence or to constrain subjective value choices. Concerns about the impact of vaguely drafted provisions in existing investment treaties are well documented. It is reasonable to assume that drafting states’ obligations with greater precision will constrain the scope of investment arbitrators’ interpretive discretion. The TPP, CETA and draft TTIP provisions on fair and equitable treatment, indirect expropriation, national treatment and exceptions contain several instances of greater precision than provisions seen in the majority of existing treaties. Yet, these provisions continue to grant broad discretion to investment arbitrators through the use of evaluative language such as ‘manifestly arbitrary’, ‘rare circumstances’, ‘excessive’, and ‘necessary’. Experience from the body of decided investment cases suggests that these provisions might not go far enough toward ensuring that non-discriminatory public welfare measures do not attract liability. The article concludes that the TTIP negotiating parties—and states negotiating other investment treaties—should consider drafting such provisions with greater precision so as to further reduce the breadth of adjudicative discretion entrusted to tribunals.", 05 April 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 1, March 2016, Pages 27–50, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw001
2,Challenging the Use of Special 301 against Measures Promoting Access to Medicines: Options Under the WTO Agreements,['Suzanne Zhou'],"In April 2014, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) listed India on its Special 301 Priority Watch List, following India’s refusal to grant a patent over the leukaemia drug Gleevec and its compulsory licensing of the cancer drug Nexavar. USTR also undertook an out-of-cycle review of India’s intellectual property laws, to determine whether or not to upgrade India to the more serious Priority Foreign Country status, which would potentially trigger retaliation through withdrawal of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) benefits. In response, India threatened to take the USA to the World Trade Organization’s (WTO’s) Dispute Settlement Body over Special 301. This article examines whether such a challenge to Special 301 in the WTO would succeed, both in the India context and more generally. It takes three lines of inquiry. The first is whether or not the Special 301 procedure violates the procedural obligations under Article 23 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). The second is whether or not any related withdrawal of GSP benefits would be in line with the Enabling Clause. Finally, the article examines whether there are substantive limitations on intellectual property protections under TRIPS which could be used to challenge the validity of Special 301. It concludes that some, but not all, aspects of Special 301 may be inconsistent with WTO obligations.", 21 March 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 1, March 2016, Pages 51–86, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw004
3,Intellectual Property Rights as Protected Investments: How Open are the Gates?,"['Carlos Correa', ' Jorge E. Viñuales']","The protection afforded to different legally-defined objects may overlap when different regimes apply to the same object. This article focuses on the overlap of two protective regimes, intellectual property rights (IPRs) and international investment agreements (IIAs), as applied to certain intangible objects, such as an invention, a distinctive mark or the expression of an artistic work. More specifically, we analyse the interactions between the different regulatory layers and provisions that govern the possibility of bringing IPRs under the protection of IIAs. After some general remarks on the references to IPRs in investment agreements (II), we focus on three main understandings of such interactions (III), namely delegation (by an investment agreement to domestic law), autonomy (of the definition of IPRs in investment agreements), and articulation (of all the relevant regulatory layers to circumscribe the scope of the legally-protected object). In a final section, we draw some conclusions with a view to guide current and future practice (IV).", 09 April 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 1, March 2016, Pages 91–120, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw005
4,Interpreting the Overlap of International Investment and Intellectual Property Law,['Susy Frankel'],"Many investment agreements include intellectual property (IP) in the definition of ‘covered investment’ or ‘asset’. Until recently, what this means in practice has not been the center of any significant dispute. Now some IP right holders are challenging domestic IP law through investor-state arbitration. In such disputes, the interpretation of relevant international agreements is subject to the rules of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which require an analysis of the object and purpose of the treaty being interpreted. The object and purpose of international IP law are not only to provide rights holders with levels of protection at domestic law, but also to enable national regimes to calibrate IP law to meet certain domestic goals. Such goals relate predominantly to incentives to innovate or create, which are broader than simply protection and include, for example, the need to encourage follow-on innovation. Also, related to IP law are other goals such as access to information and availability and affordability of pharmaceuticals. The objects and purposes of investment agreements are primarily about protecting investment from expropriation and ensuring fair treatment at domestic law. Thus, the protection of IP and the protection of investment as matters of international law overlap but are far from identical objectives. This article discusses how the objects and purposes of IP as an investment asset should be interpreted within the framework of investment disputes on the basis of Vienna Convention rules.", 14 April 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 1, March 2016, Pages 121–143, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw016
5,Fair and Equitable Treatment and Judicial Patent Decisions,"['Kathleen Liddell', ' Michael Waibel']","This article focuses on the increased scope for tension between obligations under investment treaties, particularly fair and equitable treatment (FET), and the interpretation of national patent law by domestic courts. Precisely because investment treaties were created to protect investors from State-led mistreatment and bias, and investment treaties include intellectual property (IP) rights in their definition of investment, the question is how much flexibility national courts retain in applying, interpreting, and developing IP laws. The implication of international investment treaties limiting long-standing flexibilities in IP law could be serious and profound. What more precisely are the implications of the international investment law FET standard for patent law and domestic court interpretations? Our main conclusions are: first, that investment tribunals should defer substantially to interpretations of patent law by domestic courts, limiting themselves to reviewing decisions for lack of a rational basis or lack of elementary procedural fairness (denial of justice). They should not engage in closer scrutiny. Second, if investment tribunals engage in closer scrutiny (for instance, in relation to patent decisions by other State organs, or if they reject our first conclusion), FET provides limited stability for existing patents and for patent law. Investors have no legitimate expectation that national patents will be irrevocable, that national courts will interpret domestic rules of patentability—such as utility—in a particular way, or that patent law will be static over time. However, domestic courts (and other State organs) breach FET if they contradict settled patent law and apply this to the existing patents in such a way that the patent rights are diminished, or adopt an interpretation with no rational basis.", 12 April 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 1, March 2016, Pages 145–174, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw012
6,The WTOs DSU Article 23 as Guiding Principle for the Systemic Interpretation of International Investment Agreements in the Light of TRIPs,['Simon Klopschinski'],"The Philip Morris tobacco group and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly claim in investment disputes initiated against Uruguay, Australia, and Canada that the respective host states did not treat their intellectual property rights in accordance with the relevant investment treaties. Since the claimants also substantiate their assertions by alleging violations of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) committed by the host states, the need to better understand the interaction between investment treaties and TRIPs has increased significantly.
This article suggests using Article 23 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) as a guiding principle for the systemic interpretation of investment treaties in the light of TRIPs. The provision as such prohibits the enforcement of WTO law outside the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. In the context of systemic interpretation, DSU Article 23 instructs arbitral tribunals not to use investment treaties as vehicles for redressing violations of TRIPs committed by the host state.", 14 April 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 1, March 2016, Pages 211–239, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw011
7,Challenging Compliance with International Intellectual Property Norms in Investor–state Dispute Settlement,['Henning Grosse Ruse-Khan'],"Enforcing intellectual property (IP) rights abroad is not easy—not least because international IP treaties do not create global rights that can be invoked in national courts. International investment law offers potential routes for overcoming these hurdles. Whenever investment treaties include IP rights as an investment and allow for investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS), investors can challenge host state measures affecting their IP rights in ISDS proceedings. As this article will show, this in turn offers a unique opportunity for invoking the standards of protection under international investment agreements (IIAs) to challenge host state compliance with international IP treaties.
While challenging national IP regimes is an attractive option for right holders, these challenges potentially amount to a sea change for the international IP regime and cause serious concern for host states. I, however, argue that most of the routes pursued by right holders under IIAs are unlikely to be successful. Investment protection standards such as fair and equitable treatment, umbrella clauses, and most-favoured nation treatment should not be construed to allow invoking alleged breaches of international IP norms in ISDS. Some IIAs, however, contain clauses that subject expropriation claims against compulsory licenses and other IP limitations to a test of consistency with the international IP rules governing these limitations. As they offer the only feasible route for investors to challenge host state compliance with international IP treaties, I review the implications of these clauses, recent reform proposals, and suggest alternative mechanisms for aligning international IP and investment protection based on general international law.", 29 March 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 1, March 2016, Pages 241–277, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw009
