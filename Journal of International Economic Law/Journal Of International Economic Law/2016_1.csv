0,Professor John H. Jackson’s contributions to Development in WTO Law,['Edna Ramirez-Robles'],"This article identifies Professor's Jackson philosophies which permeated the “development aspect” of WTO Law. Firstly, it illustrates that throughout, he influenced the WTO legal framework. Specifically, he inspired GATT Contracting Parties in the establishment of the WTO's institutional structure. His motivation was to improve the accuracy of the GATT rules applicable to developing countries. One of his most prevalent innovative strategies included a rule-based WTO dispute settlement system. In the Doha Development Agenda, he recommended the modification of the decision-making process with the objective of enhancing the participation of developing and LDC Members.
Secondly, Prof. Jackson educated fellows, therefore pioneering the development of new WTO experts. Under his directorship, a new vigorous platform comprising researchers was founded, namely, the Institute of International of Economic Law (IIEL). Amongst them were world prominent professors from the Editorial Board of the Journal of International Economic Law (JIEL); International students and editorial assistants. Prof. Jackson also included professionals from developing countries and LDCs, thereby increasing capacities for integration of their respective countries into the WTO community. His annual conferences which were hosted in Washington D.C. and London were attended by lawyers, diplomats and economists, amongst others. These conferences remain, and serve as a reminder of the legacy that he created.", 16 June 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 2, June 2016, Pages 363–366, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw022
1,Why Treaty Interpretation and Adjudication Require ‘Constitutional Mind-Sets’,['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"In numerous publications, John Jackson emphasized ‘the strong link between international law and national constitutional systems, which must be understood in order to understand the international economic system’. 1 This short contribution in memory of John endorses—and elaborates on—Jackson's proposition that ‘international lawyers must morph into constitutional lawyers’ and adopt a ‘constitutional approach to international law’. 2 John's regular visits to the World Trade Organization (WTO) at Geneva and the European Union (EU) institutions at Brussels, like his participation in trade law conferences all over the world, illustrated his ‘cosmopolitan commitment’ (as a ‘citizen of the world’) to building a stronger international legal and mutually beneficial trading community. Yet, his ‘constitutional mind-set’ remained rooted in the unique US constitutional law system rather than in rights-based ‘cosmopolitan constitutionalism’ or market-based ‘economic cosmopolitanism’.", 04 May 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 2, June 2016, Pages 389–392, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw042
2,Security Exceptions in the WTO System: Bridge or Bottle-Neck for Trade and Security?,"['Ji Yeong Yoo', ' Dukgeun Ahn']","The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article XXI remains intact, without any modification, since the inception of the GATT in 1947. Recent economic and political developments, however, are not well addressed in the Security Exceptions enshrined in Article XXI. Moreover, the security exceptions that have been incorporated into the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement feature some discrepancies as compared to the text in the GATT, which causes confusion. Some free trade agreements have occasionally introduced security exception provisions as well, with notable distinctions compared to those of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The current world trading system has to deal with wholly different dimensions of national security such as cyber-security, terrorism, and energy security. This situation raises an imminent question on how to make those arcane security exception provisions effectively workable legal disciplines. This article examines legal developments in WTO and Free Trade Agreement security exceptions and diagnoses the systematic challenges to effectively apply the Security Exceptions. The WTO Members need to address this issue as early as possible to avoid an unnecessary and inappropriate burden for the dispute settlement system.", 13 May 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 2, June 2016, Pages 417–444, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw049
3,The US Shaping of State-Owned Enterprise Disciplines in the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"['Julien Sylvestre Fleury', ' Jean-Michel Marcoux']","The involvement of states as commercial actors in the marketplace can potentially distort trade and investment patterns. This article addresses the inclusion of a chapter on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and designated monopolies in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in light of the avowed intent of the USA to elaborate a 21st-century free trade agreement template. More specifically, it argues that the outcome of the negotiations reflects the role of the USA as a norm entrepreneur to shape an innovative set of SOE disciplines. Publicly available statements made during the course of the TPP negotiations illustrate this role of the USA. Moreover, a comparison with the provisions of other free trade agreements signed by the USA suggests that the SOE disciplines found in the TPP extensively build on the previous practice of the USA, as well as the position advanced by this negotiating Party. Provisions pertaining to the definition of entities covered by this chapter, scope and exclusions, commercial considerations, non-discrimination, regulatory discretion, non-commercial assistance, exceptions, transparency, and dispute settlement support this argument.", 03 May 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 2, June 2016, Pages 445–465, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw046
4,Measures with Multiple Competing Purposes after EC – Seal Products : Avoiding a Conflict between GATT Article XX-Chapeau and Article 2.1 TBT Agreement,['Gracia Marín Durán'],"One of the issues on which the report of the Appellate Body in EC – Seal Products has stirred considerable debate among legal academics is how to deal with product regulations allegedly having multiple policy purposes under World Trade Organization (WTO) law. For the most part, academic discussions have focused on the Appellate Body’s analysis of this issue under the chapeau of Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This article seeks to contribute to this debate by taking a more systemic perspective and considering also how this type of measure would be appraised under Article 2.1 Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). It begins by examining why measures purportedly balancing multiple competing purposes, as in the EC - Seal Products case, may necessitate justification under WTO law and why the Appellate Body’s self-imposed rational connection requirement is not appropriate to that end. A second argument advanced in this article is that, contrary to what the Appellate Body appeared to suggest in EC – Seal Products , the legal standards for justifying discrimination under the GATT Article XX-chapeau and Article 2.1 TBT Agreement should be essentially the same, and thus conflicting interpretations avoided in relation to the rational connection standard. A two-tier test for bringing in line these justification provisions is suggested which enquires, first, into whether there is a genuinely legitimate rationale for the discrimination, and secondly, whether the discriminatory impact is necessary to achieve that legitimate purpose.", 26 May 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 2, June 2016, Pages 467–495, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw015
5,What’s Wrong with EU Anti-Circumvention Rules and How to Fix it,"['Arnoud R. Willems', ' Bregt Natens']","Where circumvention of anti-dumping duties is taking place, some countries’ anti-dumping laws allow the extension of the anti-dumping duty to imports of the like product from a third country, or of a slightly modified product from a third country or the country subject to the duty. The objective of anti-circumvention rules is to ensure the effectiveness of the imposed anti-dumping duties, i.e. that no unfairly traded products are sold on the export market. However, most anti-circumvention rules do not require the investigating authorities to conduct a fully fledged anti-dumping investigation in order to extend the anti-dumping duties. Taking EU anti-circumvention provisions as an example, this article explains, first, that anti-circumvention provisions are imperfect in addressing circumvention practices from a substantive perspective; second, that these provisions arguably are inconsistent with the World Trade Organization’s Anti-dumping Agreement; and, third, that the laudable objective behind such rules can be achieved by using other legal tools.", 06 May 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 2, June 2016, Pages 497–514, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw045
6,The Future of EU Trade Defence Investigations against Imports from China,['Jochem de Kok'],"China’s ‘Non-Market Economy’ (NME) status, under which the EU may, prima facie , reject the appropriateness of domestic Chinese prices in the calculation of anti-dumping duties, has sustained consistent criticism and constitutes one of the most contentious issues in EU–Chinese bilateral relations. Despite claims to the contrary, the EU may no longer have recourse to the NME methodology after 11 December 2016, by virtue of the expiration of a key provision in China’s Accession Protocol to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Since some of the underlying concerns that triggered the creation of this provision may persist following December 2016, the EU may resort to other alternative methods. Firstly, the European Commission has often used the cost construction method under the Anti-Dumping Agreement to counteract NME like situations. However, the recent ruling of the panel in EU—Biodiesel has found this method to be largely incompatible with WTO law. Secondly, China’s Accession Protocol provides for special benchmarking and state owned enterprises provisions in the context of subsidy investigations that may serve as a means to counteract government subsidization. Thirdly, safeguards could also provide for an alternative method to counteract sharp unforeseen increases of imports causing or threatening to cause serious injury to Union producers. These alternative methods will likely replace the current NME methodology as a major source of contention between the EU and China.", 24 May 2016,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 19, Issue 2, June 2016, Pages 515–547, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgw044
