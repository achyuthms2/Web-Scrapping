0,"The Authoritative Interpretation Under Article IX:2 of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization: Current Law, Practice and Possible Improvements","['Claus-Dieter Ehlermann', ' Lothar Ehring']","The Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization reserves the right to adopt ‘authoritative interpretations’ of the multilateral trade agreements to the Ministerial Conference and the General Council. Given that, to date, this instrument has not been used, the present article intends to highlight its structural importance for the balance of powers within the legal system of the World Trade Organization. It identifies the use that could and should be made of it and reviews the practice so far. The article attempts to explain the reasons for the present lack of authoritative interpretations in the World Trade Organization and presents several options for the future. At the outset, this article explores the parameters that are relevant for this discussion, notably the possible scope and legal effects of an authoritative interpretation. Important questions are whether an authoritative interpretation is legally binding on all WTO Members, whether it may modify the existing law or whether the rules of treaty interpretation are relevant in the formulation of an authoritative interpretation, and whether its validity can be challenged in dispute settlement.", 14 November 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 4, December 2005, Pages 803–824, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi047
1,Legal Problems of Making Regional Trade Agreements with Non-WTO-Member States,['Won-Mog Choi'],"In pursuing regional economic integration with non-WTO-member economies, a WTO member must be aware that WTO compliance is under question. An exchange of preferential treatment between the WTO-member party and non-WTO-member parties gives rise to a violation by the WTO member of the MFN treatment obligation of the WTO Agreement. In the case of integration in the service sector, consistency with WTO jurisprudence is guaranteed, whereas in integrating the goods sector, WTO consistency can only be guaranteed when the non-WTO-member parties are least-developed countries. Furthermore in the TRIPs sector, the WTO compliance is not questionable only when the RTA reconfirms original rights and duties arising under the TRIPs Agreement. Thus, in order to be consistent with WTO jurisprudence, regional integration agreements in the area of trade in goods need to be approved by a two-thirds majority of the WTO members, before they come into force. Or, the WTO member could encourage the non-WTO-member state to join the WTO before their RTA comes into force. On the other hand, in the case of economic integration in the service sector, as non-WTO-member status of any counterpart economies does not act as a legal impediment, the WTO members may pursue more active negotiations, while remaining consistent with WTO jurisprudence. In drafting and negotiating on IPR chapters under RTAs, WTO members must be vigilant not to mutually exchange a higher level of IPR protection than that stipulated under the TRIPs Agreement.", 14 November 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 4, December 2005, Pages 825–860, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi048
2,WTO Dispute Settlement and the Missing Developing Country Cases: Engaging the Private Sector,"['Chad P. Bown', ' Bernard M. Hoekman']","The poorest WTO member countries almost universally fail to engage as either complainants or interested third parties in formal dispute settlement activity related to their market access interests. This paper focuses on costs of the WTO’s extended litigation process as an explanation for the potential but ‘missing’ developing country engagement. We provide a positive examination of the current system, and we catalogue and analyze a set of proposals encouraging the private sector to provide DSU-specific legal assistance to poor countries. We investigate the role of legal service centres, non-governmental organizations, development organizations, international trade litigators, economists, consumer organizations, and law schools to provide poor countries with the services needed at critical stages of the WTO’s extended litigation process. In the absence of systemic rules reform, the public-private partnership model imposes a substantial cooperation burden on such groups as they organize export interests, estimate the size of improved market access payoffs, prioritize across potential cases, engage domestic governments, prepare legal briefs, assist in evidentiary discovery, and pursue the public relations effort required to induce foreign political compliance.", 14 November 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 4, December 2005, Pages 861–890, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi049
3,Interjurisdictional Competition and Regulatory Advantage,['Dale D. Murphy'],"As formal trade and investment barriers fall, government regulations – what once were domestic policy matters – become issues of international concern. International commerce creates the potential for competition among regulatory jurisdictions. This article explains why there is variation in these regulatory trends. Three general ‘trajectories’ are: (a) convergence among countries toward less stringent regulations in some cases, (b) convergence toward more stringent regulations in others, while in still other cases (c) differences persist among countries. I offer three (related) propositions which explain the different regulatory trajectories: #1) Regulations on production processes tend toward laxity; whereas product market-access regulations tend toward stringency. #2) Industrial structure affects the strength of the process/market-access distinction. Powerful firms in concentrated markets facilitate collective action and regulatory capture. Dominant producers push for process and market-access regulations which reflect their interests, giving them a competitive regulatory advantage in world markets. #3) The asset specificity of investments affects regulatory convergence. Low asset specificity leads to a competition-in-laxity; high multinational asset specificity leads to convergence among jurisdictions (as firms seek to lower their transaction costs); and domestic asset specificity leads to differences among jurisdictions. Detailed case studies (on offshore banking, capital requirements, and infant formula) suggest the propositions are necessary to understand general outcomes, although not sufficient to fully explain individual cases.", 15 November 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 4, December 2005, Pages 891–920, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi050
4,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles: The Impact of the WTO ‘Court’ on Canada in its First Ten Years",['Jacqueline D. Krikorian'],"Observers interested in the nature and scope of judicial policy-making traditionally focused on the extent to which domestic courts shaped national policy arrangements. With the emergence of more robust international tribunals, however, many are raising questions about the degree to which foreign judges are influencing domestic legal regimes. This project addresses one corner of this debate by analysing the impact of the WTO ‘court’ on Canada. The legal challenges have provoked considerable controversy as the country has lost, either in whole or in part, each case brought against it. Moreover, there has been widespread public concern about these disputes as many have involved significant social issues. Yet despite the country’s successive defeats before the WTO ‘court’, the policy impact of the trade tribunal has been relatively modest. Contrary to suggestions, the WTO dispute settlement mechanism has not superimposed some form of neo-liberal order on the Canadian state via its judicial decision-making process.", 21 November 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 4, December 2005, Pages 921–975, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgi051
