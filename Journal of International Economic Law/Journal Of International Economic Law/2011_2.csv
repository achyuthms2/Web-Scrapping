0,Time to Quit? Assessing International Investment Claims against Plain Tobacco Packaging in Australia,"['Tania Voon', ' Andrew Mitchell']","The Australian federal government recently introduced into Parliament legislation mandating the plain packaging of all tobacco products. Tobacco companies and others have raised various legal concerns with this tobacco control scheme, both at a domestic level in relation to constitutional and intellectual property law, and at an international level in relation to international economic law. Some Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have asked questions about the scheme in the WTO's Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade and Council for Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights. In addition, Philip Morris (Asia) Limited has given notice of an investor-State dispute settlement claim against Australia regarding plain packaging pursuant to the Hong Kong–Australia Bilateral Investment Treaty. This article considers the merits of that claim as well as certain related procedural issues. It also compares Australia's investment obligations with respect to plain packaging under the Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement, as some allegations have been made that plain packaging may be inconsistent with those obligations.", 29 September 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 3, September 2011, Pages 515–552, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr030
1,"Fair in Form, But Discriminatory in Operation—WTO Law’s Discriminatory Effects on Human Rights in Developing Countries",['Gillian Moon'],"There are many points of intersection between the law of the World Trade Organization and international human rights law. This article looks at one such, where WTO law requires developing countries to introduce measures that may have disproportionately adverse impacts on the human rights of individuals or groups who are protected under human rights law from discrimination. Indirect discrimination of this kind usually occurs because prior discriminatory treatment has created social and economic inequalities that subsequent, apparently neutral—or ‘fair in form’—measures exacerbate. Country studies of Nicaragua and Ghana provide evidence that indirectly discriminatory impacts might occur as a result of the reductions in agricultural tariffs proposed in the Doha Round for developing countries. While laws which have discriminatory effects may be justifiable, discrimination on the basis of race or sex is anathema to human rights law and will be subjected to intense justificational scrutiny. The article scrutinizes the justifiability of the proposed agricultural tariff reductions, concluding that less damaging alternatives are available and could be adopted at the multilateral level. It is argued that the potential discrimination is best dealt with at this level, since it is the law-making level and the discrimination is unlikely to be corrected through domestic, remedial action within developing countries.", 25 August 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 3, September 2011, Pages 553–592, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr023
2,Fashioning a New Regime for Agricultural Trade: New Issues and the Global Food Crisis,['Thomas J. Schoenbaum'],"This article examines the impact of issues such as the global food crisis, export controls on agricultural products, and food security on the agricultural trade negotiations currently underway in connection with the Doha Development Agenda convened by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. These important issues, which were not foreseen when the negotiations began, must now be squarely faced. Many international organizations, such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and most recently the G-20, are examining in particular the problem of food security. While food security and the global food crisis require solutions and actions that are broader than international trade, trade reform in agricultural products is an essential part of their solution. This article concludes that these new issues do not change the basic international agreement that needs to be reached to reform the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. WTO members still should pursue agreement on market access, reducing and simplifying domestic support, and eliminating export subsidies. However, to deal with food security issues, WTO members should take up the export side of agricultural trade and prohibit export controls altogether, or at least enact strict criteria before export controls may be instituted by WTO members.", 19 September 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 3, September 2011, Pages 593–611, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr025
3,The Role of Rules of Origin to Provide Discipline to the Gatt Article XXIV Exception,"['Jong Bum Kim', ' Joongi Kim']","This article examines how the GATT Article XXIV regional trade agreement (RTA) exception can be strengthened to curb the proliferation of RTAs that maintain questionable levels of trade liberalization. The lack of rigorous application of the ‘substantially all the trade’ requirement and the use of rules of origin in a restrictive manner are persistent problems that have led to the exclusion of products that should otherwise be part of trade liberalization under RTAs. To provide the discipline currently lacking in Article XXIV, the internal trade under an RTA should be based upon ‘non-preferential rules of origin’ (NPROO) so that trade barriers between RTA parties with respect to ‘substantially all the trade’ will be eliminated. Furthermore, restrictive preferential rules of origin should be eliminated by replacing them with harmonized NPROO. NPROO therefore not only help define the proper scope of trade coverage for RTAs, but they also provide the proper standard to ensure that RTA rules of origin do not become impermissibly restrictive.", 24 September 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 3, September 2011, Pages 613–638, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr027
4,The Rise of National Regulatory Autonomy in the GATT/WTO Regime,['Michael Ming Du'],"This article sets forth two arguments. First, to respect a WTO Member's national regulatory autonomy in the world trading system is essential to ensure the WTO's long term success in light of the WTO's institutional constraints, the WTO's underlying philosophy and the WTO's nature as an incomplete contract. Second, and contrary to many popular criticisms against the WTO's allegedly intrusive penetration to national regulatory autonomy, this article argues that these critics have failed to appreciate the recent WTO case law developments. Indeed, the recent WTO case law has shown that the WTO Appellate Body has quietly fine-tuned its previous jurisprudence and as a result, WTO Members enjoy a broader scope of regulatory autonomy than conventionally assumed.", 29 September 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 3, September 2011, Pages 639–675, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr029
5,A Glimpse at the Democratic Legitimacy of Private Standards: Assessing the Public Accountability of GlobalG.A.P.,"['Nicolas Hachez', ' Jan Wouters']","This article seeks to shed light on a notion that is often considered essential in conferring global regulatory authority, but is rarely defined in contemporary scholarship on global governance: the notion of legitimacy. The authors centre their analysis on the value of democracy as one of the seminal determinants of the legitimacy of regulatory actors and the norms they adopt. They further focus on the democratic legitimacy of norms adopted by global private actors. A specific breed of such ‘private standards’ is studied, namely those addressing food safety. More in particular, the leading standard scheme for good agricultural practices—GLOBALG.A.P.—is taken as a case study. The authors view democratic legitimacy in global governance as a function of the ‘public accountability’ of the relevant regulatory actors, which comprises a prospective and a retrospective dimension. Public accountability is analyzed as this link which unites, in a democratic fashion, a regulatory actor and its public, i.e. the ensemble of the people who are affected by its regulatory activities. GLOBALG.A.P.’s standard-setting is assessed in light of this analytical framework. The authors find that, while the accountability of GLOBALG.A.P. as a regulatory actor in the field of food safety is satisfactory in respect of its internal members, additional efforts need to be made to ensure stronger (democratic) accountability vis-à-vis its other—external—stakeholders, particularly those located in developing countries.", 22 September 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 3, September 2011, Pages 677–710, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr026
