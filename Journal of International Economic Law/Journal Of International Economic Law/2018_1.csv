0,Another Digital Divide: The Rise of Data Realms and its Implications for the WTO,"['Susan Ariel Aaronson', ' Patrick Leblond']","Individuals, businesses, and governments increasingly use data to create new services delivered via the internet. In so doing, they are creating a new economy built on cross-border data flows. The USA, the European Union, and China are using domestic and foreign policies to reap data-based economies of scale and scope. Essentially, they have created three distinct data realms with different approaches to data governance. As a result, they have fostered a new digital divide: between the three data behemoths and other countries that are rule takers. This situation presents the WTO with a challenge and an opportunity. These three data realms could undermine the ability of the WTO to govern trade in data flows, but it also creates pressures for the three data realms to use WTO mechanisms to find common ground among their approaches. Moreover, it could provide an incentive to WTO members to create new rules governing trade in data.", 15 May 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 245–272, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy019
1,How a TPP-Style E-commerce Outcome in the WTO would Endanger the Development Dimension of the GATS Acquis (and Potentially the WTO),['Jane Kelsey'],"The World Trade Organization (WTO) faces a watershed. Developed country Members want to abandon the Doha round and negotiate ‘new issues’, notably electronic commerce, as part of a broader US-led strategy to rewrite the global trade rules for the 21st century. Developing countries insist the Doha round be concluded before considering new issues and most reject the e-commerce agenda as foreclosing their options for digital development. This standoff dominated the MC11. The new e-commerce agenda has its genesis in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Three factors complicate moves to export it to the WTO. First, those rules are blunt instruments designed to protect the first mover status and oligopolistic power of Big Tech. Second, they lack any development flexibilities or obligations. Third, their application to major developing country competitors and the potentially lucrative markets of larger developing countries requires multilateralization through the WTO, but that will be a highly contested process. That contest is now playing out through the plurilateral process announced by the e-commerce proponents during the MC11. The proposals assume a major expansion of Members’ commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Favourable interpretations of sectoral classifications, modes of trading services, and the application of technological neutrality to historical commitments would override the original GATS acquis that ensures developing countries can control their exposure, and seriously diminish their regulatory autonomy to maximize the opportunities of the digital economy and minimize the risks. Such an agenda could deepen the crisis at the WTO.", 31 May 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 273–295, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy024
2,Digital or Trade? The Contrasting Approaches of China and US to Digital Trade,['Henry Gao'],"With the growing importance of the internet, digital trade, or electronic commerce, has become a key issue in international trade regulation. As the home to some of the largest internet companies in the world, the USA took the lead in bringing the issue into the WTO and has been the leading proponent on the issue. In contrast, the developing countries were quite sceptical and reluctant to engage on discussions on the issue. Recently, however, several developing countries have changed their positions and become more active participants. Chief among them is China, which has raised some interesting proposals both within and beyond the WTO. The issue also emerged as one of the main issues discussed at the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO. This article provides a critical examination of the contrasting approaches of the US and China on the issue. It argues that, the US approach tends to focus more on the ‘digital’ nature of digital trade, while the Chinese approach prefers to address the issue from the traditional ‘trade’ perspective. The article analyses the reasons for the different approaches, and provides some suggestions on how to move forward on the issue at MC11 and beyond given the differences between the two approaches.", 16 May 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 297–321, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy015
3,Understanding the Role of the WTO in International Data Flows: Taking the Liberalization or the Regulatory Autonomy Path?,['Nivedita Sen'],"Recent years have witnessed a surge in discussions relating to data and data flow in trade fora. This was predictable given the importance of data for trade in the digital economy, especially e-commerce. However, there is a major discord between WTO members on issues relating to data flows and data localization. This article sets out to understand how data flows across borders and the types of trade restrictive data localization measures members use. The analysis of various restrictions on data flows imposed by states reflects the different objectives behind them, targeting all or specific types of data. Such regulations potentially violate existing WTO commitments. The article concludes with a call for issuing a multilateral amendment of existing norms, and undertaking a data differentiated approach to resolve the deadlock at the WTO.", 25 May 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 323–348, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy021
4,Using Trade Facilitation to Assist MSMEs in E-Commerce in Developing Countries,['Rutendo Tavengerwei'],"In anticipation of the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC11), several developing country Members submitted proposals reflecting concerns related with e-commerce and the continued involvement of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in cross-border e-commerce. Some developing countries perceive the booming significance of MSMEs as an opportunity to further enhance their economic relevance by incorporating them into e-commerce. The increase of MSMEs in e-commerce has also been reflected by the International Trade Centre (ITC). In one of the ITC’s most recent surveys conducted on 2262 firms, the statistics indicated that of the firms that engage solely in cross-border e-commerce, 82% are MSMEs. Notwithstanding these significant changes on the ground, Members have differed significantly in their views since 1998 concerning the e-commerce agenda. This has created considerable inroads in defining what e-commerce is as well as the rules that should regulate e-commerce. More recently, the e-commerce dialogue has reflected concerns on how the WTO could potentially deal with the rapid inclusion of MSMEs in the market through e-commerce. Although all companies face red tape in cross-border trade, due to size and financial constraints, MSMEs in developing countries face the most challenges in cross-border e-commerce. Many of these problems are related to the cross-border delivery of goods, the after-sales services as well as limited cross-border de minimis exemptions that discourages MSMEs from e-trading. Therefore, several Members consider that it is vital to continue to work on trade facilitation matters, especially those that are forward looking and can better assist MSMEs to better integrate into the e-commerce world. This article adopts two specific discussion points based on the proposals submitted by different Members for the WTO MC11 suggesting ways to move forward. First, using case studies from different countries, the article will focus on some of the challenges faced by MSMEs in developing countries, such as inefficient customs administration which is a result of issues related to cross-border trade. Part of this discussion will also assess how developing countries can use the recently agreed TFA to address these issues. The second part of the article will focus on how current provisions in the TFA as well as other forward looking trade facilitation efforts that are not reflected in the agreement, can help MSMEs to benefit from cross-border e-commerce. In relation to this part of the discussion, an exploration of the possibilities of technical assistance and capacity building that is e-commerce relevant would thus be necessary. Finally the article will conclude, highlighting limitations associated with the recommendations given.", 18 June 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 349–378, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy022
5,Exit from Trade Agreements: A Reputational Analysis of Cooperation and Fairness,['Rachel Brewster'],"The last three years have been marked more by exits from trade agreements than by the successful completion of major additional pacts. While most of the international trade literature focuses on the best methods of better integrating national markets, this article seeks to examine the effect of exit on international relations. We generally assume that the costs of severing economic ties is enough to maintain trade agreements, but that proposition no longer seems robust in our current moment of widespread dissatisfaction with trade relations. This article, therefore, seeks to look outside of trade-related costs of exit to possible extralegal costs, particularly reputational or community costs, of exit. The article also aims to provide the first cut of distinguishing between the two types of reputations—one for being ‘uncooperative’ and one for being ‘unfair’. Drawing on behavioral theories, the article begins to develop a distinction between an audience’s belief that a state is acting ‘uncooperatively’ as compared to ‘unfairly’ and what the consequences of this distinction may be. The article illustrates how different types of exit can have divergent reputational effects.", 16 May 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 379–393, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy018
6,"Single Undertaking, Different Speeds: Pliable Models for Decision-making in the WTO",['Alex Ansong'],"The provisions on decision-making in the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement) have fundamental constitutional significance for the running of the WTO. The decision-making procedures established in Articles IX, X and XII of the WTO Agreement are therefore foundational to any discussion on reform of WTO decision-making and the creation of a more pliable system that is able to respond to the new and emerging challenges in the international trade regime. This article explores the provisions on amendments in Article X of the WTO Agreement and conducts analyses of how resort to the amendments provisions can possibly be used proactively to temper the current impasse-prone state of WTO decision-making. It also discusses the adoption of the Trade Facilitation Agreement in February 2017 and explores the possible lessons on decision-making that can be learnt from this landmark Agreement. The main theme that runs through the discussions in this article is the need to temper the rigid effects of single undertaking and consensus in WTO decision-making with more flexible mechanisms without the need for law reform.", 23 May 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 395–410, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy017
7,The WTO and the Rise of Plurilateralism—What Lessons can we Learn from the European Union’s Experience with Differentiated Integration?,['Robert Basedow'],"The de facto failure of the Doha Round has shaken the confidence in multilateral trade negotiations and governance. Policy-makers increasingly turn to plurilateralism—in the form of Plurilateral and Critical Mass Agreements—as a new strategy for global trade governance. The World Trade Organization (WTO) may develop into a ‘club of clubs’. The rise of plurilateralism creates opportunities and risks. Plurilateralism may reinvigorate world trade and modernise the WTO. But it may also fragment the global trade regime and disenfranchise countries. The article advances two arguments. First, the turn to plurilateralism is timely and promises to be welfare-enhancing as trade liberalization evolves from negative integration through tariff cuts to positive integration through rule convergence. Plurilateralism is often better suited to govern rule convergence. The article builds on the theory of club goods to underpin this claim. Second, the turn to plurilateralism nonetheless requires a carefully crafted governance approach to succeed. The article thus evaluates the rich experience of the European Union with so-called ‘differentiated integration’ to inform the policy debate in the WTO. It highlights that inter alia transparency, trust and institutional embedding are key to ensure that the WTO and her members benefit from the rise of plurilateralism.", 18 June 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 411–431, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy020
8,Ensuring Continued Support for the Rules-Based Multilateral Trading System: The Need for a Public–Private Approach,['Dylan Geraets'],"The stability and resilience of intergovernmental and supranational institutions is increasingly being tested. The constraints that the WTO Agreement places on executive organs in its Members are being questioned in academia and by politicians. Reform of institutional aspects of the WTO’s dispute settlement process is coupled to the re-appointment of Appellate Body Members. These are interesting times for the rules-based multilateral trading system, to say the least. This think piece raises more questions than it can possibly answer. Yet, a central element that runs as a common thread through this contribution is the question whether trade liberalization, free movement of capital, and the resulting facilitation and emergence of GVCs have resulted in an inability of WTO Members to address domestic problems such as unemployment among workers in the manufacturing industry. Technological innovations such as automation and digitalization have equally contributed to a shift in the labour market from the manufacturing sector to other sectors.
This raises questions as to the most appropriate and effective way to address the negative aspects of globalization and to ensure that the support for the rules-based multilateral trading system is not eroded. This contribution addresses the current criticism of the negative side effects of globalization and examines proposals at the bilateral level that are aimed at “conditionalizing” the liberalisation of trade. Thereafter it advocates a “public-private” approach at the domestic level which involves all stakeholders, as it is essential that those “left-behind” by globalisation are actively engaged with.", 07 May 2018,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 21, Issue 2, June 2018, Pages 433–450, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgy016
