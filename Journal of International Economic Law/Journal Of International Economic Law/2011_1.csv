0,Protecting Public Morals in a Digital Age: Revisiting the WTO Rulings on US – Gambling and China – Publications and Audiovisual Products,['Panagiotis Delimatsis'],"Values such as promoting free trade in services or protecting public morality coexist in a perilous balance nowadays. This peril appears to be exacerbated by the manifold possibilities of supplying services that the digital age brings with it. Technological advances and innovations transform the manner that services are supplied and call for swift reaction by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, electronic communications erode long-standing traditions in regulating various services industries (supply side) and consumer behaviour (consumption side) and sometimes allow for easy circumvention of law. The US – Gambling and China – Audiovisual Products rulings are the first pronouncements of the World Trade Organization (WTO) judiciary on the possible clash between trade expansion, on the one hand, and protection of public morals, on the other. After a critical review of these two important recent rulings on the concept of public morality and its treatment by the WTO judiciary, the article goes on to discuss the changing scope of regulatory sovereignty regarding the protection of public morality in a digital landscape; the paradigm shift in regulatory approaches that technological advances bring about; and the role of courts and non-state actors in the regulation of cyberspace.", 28 May 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 2, June 2011, Pages 257–293, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr012
1,"Of Facts and Phantoms: Economics, Epistemic Legitimacy, and WTO Dispute Settlement",['CA Thomas'],"World Trade Organization panels are regularly required to address specifically economic evidence and arguments when resolving disputes. Economic arguments provide the basic foundations for many disputes, and parties are proving increasingly willing to contest the facts underlying those arguments. Despite this, panels have often failed to engage satisfactorily with economic reasoning. The deficiencies in panels’ reasoning have been exacerbated by their refusal to seek information and advice from independent economic experts. This approach is neither necessary nor productive. It undermines the epistemic legitimacy of individual panel reports and the political legitimacy of the dispute settlement system more generally. More careful and rigorous panel engagement with economic evidence, as assisted by independent experts acting within appropriate limits, would go some way to reducing this legitimacy deficit while improving the accuracy and finality of the dispute settlement system.", 08 July 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 2, June 2011, Pages 295–328, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr018
2,Countervailing Duty against China: Opening a Pandora's Box in the WTO System?,"['Dukgeun Ahn', ' Jieun Lee']","In this article, we trace the jurisprudential history of the applicability of US countervailing duty (CVD) law to non-market economies (NMEs). We describe how, since the USA reversed its long-standing policy of not imposing CVDs on NMEs, concurrent application of antidumping (AD) duties and CVDs has become the country's major trade remedy action against China. Although the WTO panel rejected China's claim of WTO-inconsistency regarding the current US practices, the US Court of International Trade firmly ruled that the Department of Commerce's double counting of AD duties and CVDs against China violates domestic regulation. Finally, the WTO Appellate Body ruled that this ‘double remedy’ violates the rule to levy CVDs ‘in the appropriate amounts’ under Article 19.3 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. We will argue that, although the Appellate Body's ruling is praiseworthy in preventing an illogical practice, its legal reasoning may give rise to some doubts and controversy when the negotiating history of Article 19 is examined. We will also analyze key features of current double remedy practices in the USA and Canada.", 24 June 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 2, June 2011, Pages 329–368, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr015
3,A Framework for Thinking about the ‘Discretion’ in the Mandatory/Discretionary Distinction,['Simon Lester'],"The mandatory/discretionary distinction that has been applied to ‘as such’ challenges in WTO disputes is the subject of a good deal of disagreement, both as to its scope and its continued applicability. In this piece, I put forward a framework for thinking about the kinds of discretion that may exist in a measure, focusing on two general categories of discretion and presenting a way to evaluate the ‘degrees’ of discretion based on these categories. This framework can be applied regardless of which view is taken on the proper role of the distinction. In addition, I offer some thoughts on the basis for the distinction between mandatory and discretionary measures and, taking into account the framework developed, on how the distinction should be applied.", 22 June 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 2, June 2011, Pages 369–402, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr016
4,The Limits of WTO Adjudication: Is Compliance the Problem?,['Juscelino F. Colares'],"Mainstream international trade law scholars have commented positively on the work of World Trade Organization (WTO) adjudicators. This favorable view is both echoed and challenged by empirical scholarship that shows a high disparity between Complainant and Respondent success rates (Complainants win between 80 and 90 percent of the disputes). Regardless of how one interprets these results, mainstream theorists, especially legalists, believe more is to be done to strengthen the system, and they point to instances of member recalcitrance to implement rulings as a serious problem. This article posits that such attempts to strengthen compliance are ill-advised. After discussing prior empirical analyses of WTO adjudication involving primary rights and obligations under the WTO agreements (i.e. substantive adjudication), this article expands the empirical study into compliance disputes. It finds that ‘enforcement’ proceedings do protect the pro-free trade interests so overwhelmingly supported in substantive adjudication. Since that is the case, this article investigates the extent to which current levels of non-compliance might constitute a threat to this regime, and theorizes that the observed level is not only acceptable but a necessary feature of the system. I conclude by arguing that compliance-related issues must be viewed in a broader perspective that transcends narrow legalistic views and accounts for the multifaceted interests of, and differences among, WTO members.", 08 July 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 2, June 2011, Pages 403–436, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr014
5,Preventing Opportunistic Uncompliance by WTO Members,"['David J. Townsend', ' Steve Charnovitz']","The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Dispute Settlement Understanding is silent on the consequences for members if they comply with trade obligations, but later uncomply, resulting in similar violations as those giving rise to the original dispute. This article shows that WTO members can uncomply without facing economic consequences because the arbitrators that authorize the suspension of WTO concessions have a limited jurisdiction relative to compliance panels and because the DSU does not provide sanctions for past (in contrast to ongoing) violations. Members may thus delay compliance until immediately before panels assess their compliance record and then may uncomply because arbitrators cannot authorize the suspension of concessions for the measure to uncomply. Cases of uncompliance allow members to commit repeated violations with impunity. This contrasts with cases of non-compliance, where trade disputes eventually result in implementation of recommendations, compensation to the aggrieved member, or the suspension of concessions against the violating member. We identify the ongoing US – Upland Cotton dispute as a potential case of uncompliance. WTO members have an opportunity to protect themselves from delayed compliance and uncompliance by seeking authorization to suspend concessions where the violating member has not taken measures within the timeframe given to comply. We show that because Brazil forfeited its rights to do so in the US – Upland Cotton dispute through a sequencing agreement, the United States may have uncomplied without facing a countermeasure for certain cotton subsidies.", 08 July 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 2, June 2011, Pages 437–468, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr021
6,Antinomies of Public and Private at the Foundations of International Investment Law and Arbitration,['Alex Mills'],"International investment law has in recent years become a topic of great practical and academic importance, as the thousands of international investment treaties have given rise to hundreds of investor-state arbitrations, and innumerable books and articles. But fundamental questions concerning the regulatory character of international investment law, and what its aims and objectives are, remain the subject of contestation reflected in a variety of policy debates and in competing historical narratives regarding the development of the field.
This article contends that two ‘public–private’ distinctions or antinomies lie behind this indeterminacy, at international investment law’s uncertain foundations—the first dealing with the characterization of international investment law as a form of ‘public’ or ‘private’ law, and the second dealing with the balance that international investment law strikes between ‘public’ and ‘private’ interests or objectives. A number of disputed issues in international investment law and arbitration, which are presented at the surface as merely technical problems, may in reality, it is argued, be products of these deeper underlying theoretical uncertainties.", 06 July 2011,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 14, Issue 2, June 2011, Pages 469–503, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgr020
