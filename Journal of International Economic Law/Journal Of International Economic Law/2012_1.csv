0,Beyond the Text: The Significance of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement,['Bryan Mercurio'],"The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) aims to combat the proliferation of counterfeit and pirated goods ‘through enhanced international cooperation and more effective international enforcement’. Despite news reports and academic commentary to the contrary, the first part of this article demonstrates that the finalized version of the ACTA does not meaningfully enhance the international intellectual property (IP) law framework as it relates to international cooperation or international enforcement and therefore does not pose a substantial risk to the public or to domestic sovereignty. This is not to say that the ACTA does not have value; the second part of the article argues that the real significance of the ACTA lies not in its textual obligations but more in the effect it will potentially have as a starting point in multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations, as an alternative forum for IP rulemaking and on the ‘governance’ of international IP more generally.", 05 April 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 361–390, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs018
1,Flesh on a Legal Fiction: Early Practice in the WTO on Accession Protocols,['Mitali Tyagi'],"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has recently seen a spate of disputes over provisions in an unfamiliar instrument, the Protocol of Accession. While the process of accession to the WTO is traditionally an intensely political and secretive one, the focus of this article is on the novel legal implications of modern-day Protocols of Accession. It seeks to examine the clandestine manoeuvrings of the accession process that are, arguably, fracturing the single undertaking of rules in the WTO. Valuable work done by commentators thus far has provided a reservoir of information about the content of certain Protocols of Accession and the divergence from the common law of the WTO (WTO-plus or WTO-minus provisions in Protocols of Accession). This article seeks to build on that work by examining the recent troubling dispute settlement activity in the realm of Protocols of Accession and by introducing a scrutiny of the legality of certain provisions of the Protocol of Accession. This article argues that the true effect of certain provisions in Protocols of Accession is aptly described as an ‘impermissible reservation’ to WTO agreements. In this regard it analyses and critiques the recent work of the International Law Commission on Reservations.", 25 May 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 391–441, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs025
2,Defining the Legal Boundaries of Export Restrictions: A Case Law Analysis,['Baris Karapinar'],"It is widely recognized that the World Trade Organization (WTO) law on export restrictions is an area of ‘under-regulation’—as it neither defines the circumstances that justify quantitative restrictions nor regulates export duties. There are also additional legal uncertainties due to the ‘WTO-plus’ commitments imposed on a few new Members. In the absence of legal clarity, it is crucial to have a consistent interpretation of the existing law and the jurisprudence. In this context, by analysing five relevant cases which have been brought before the WTO/General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), including the recent China – Raw Materials, this article attempts to shed light on the legal boundaries of export restrictions. It examines the panels’ interpretation of the definition of the relevant legal terms, such as ‘critical shortage’ of ‘essential products’, and ‘temporarily applied’. It reviews the accession protocols of the new Members, and analyses how the emerging case law might constrain their policy space. It also scrutinizes the panels’ interpretation of GATT Article XX in examining the relationship between the design of export restrictions and their intended environmental objectives. It is envisaged that the case law analysis of the legal scope of export restrictions could inform the future reform efforts in this field.", 02 May 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 443–479, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs021
3,Essential Security Interests in International Investment Agreements,['William J. Moon'],"Embedded in a significant number of international investment agreements are provisions that allow states to invoke essential security interests at times of necessity to limit the application of substantive treaty agreements. These provisions, which are largely devoid of express signatory intent, have caused an intensified debate over their scope and meaning in light of recent investor-state arbitration proceedings against Argentina. This article investigates the historical origins and state usage of security provisions found in international economic agreements and argues an essential security defense may be raised only in circumstances involving national security interests. While states ought to be given a margin of appreciation on what constitutes a threat to their own national security interests, the burden falls on the signatory states to diverge from the shared linguistic expectations attached to the ordinary usage of treaty terms. This approach injects a degree of predictability into the meaning of otherwise silent terms, reducing the detrimental reliance problem introduced by treaties that are designed to induce good faith investment by third-party beneficiaries.", 10 May 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 481–502, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs024
4,"The Impact of WTO Transparency Rules: Is the 10,000th SPS Notification a Cause for Celebration?—A Case Study of EU Practice",['Chris Downes'],"The World Trade Organization (WTO) members are increasingly notifying trading partners of changes to domestic legislation under Article 7 and Annex B of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) Agreement. Nevertheless, these notifications alone provide little indication as to the extent of members’ commitment to transparency and the real contribution made by these WTO obligations to facilitating international trade. Through a case study of EU notification of food safety measures, this article explores the impact of WTO rules on the development of domestic SPS measures. While clearly committed to advancing transparency, the EU’s application of SPS norms is shown to be inconsistent in practice: non-notification of many EU and EU Member State measures and, in cases, failure to notify in a manner that allows third-country comment. This review identifies factors that complicate coherent EU implementation of transparency obligations. In spite of the deficiencies documented, the case study reveals the emergence of policy-making practices that can significantly contribute to reducing technical obstacles to agricultural trade.", 20 March 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 503–524, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs013
5,"Ain’t Wastin’ Time No More: Subsidies for Renewable Energy, The SCM Agreement, Policy Space, and Law Reform",['Luca Rubini'],"Assuming that certain subsidies to support renewable energy may be ‘good’, the central question of this article is whether World Trade Organization (WTO) subsidy disciplines recognize this and offer appropriate policy space to Members. The analysis reveals that the situation is one of diffuse legal uncertainty, if not outright conflict between policy prescriptions and trade law requirements. The argument of the article is that the uncertainty of the legal assessment in itself produces a constraint on policy space. Some issues may be clarified through litigation but this is not the optimal approach since disputes are subject to many vagaries and may offer, at best, piece-meal and partial solutions. The pressure put on the judiciary should also not be underestimated. The analysis of the credible but controversial possibility of resorting to GATT Article XX to justify certain subsidies is the best example in point. The unsatisfactory nature of the legal framework is not merely hypothetical since subsidies for renewable energy are increasingly subject to disputes at both WTO and national levels. Against this scenario of inadequate legal framework and increasing litigiousness, law reform emerges as the first-best alternative. It is claimed that what is needed is a legal shelter that, in a clear and positive way, defines what types of subsidies supporting renewable energy are legitimate and permitted.", 25 April 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 525–579, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs020
6,Movement of Capital and Trade in Services: Distinguishing Myth from Reality Regarding the GATS and the Liberalization of the Capital Account,['Federico Lupo Pasini'],"This article will analyze the interplay between capital movements and trade in services as structured in World Trade Organization (WTO) law, and it will assess the implications of the capital account liberalization for the freedom of WTO Members to pursue their economic policies. Although the movement of capital is largely confined to the domain of international financial or monetary policy, it is regulated by WTO law due to its role in the process of financial services liberalization, which generally requires liberalized capital flows. From a legal perspective, the interplay between capital movements and trade in services requires striking a delicate balance between the right of market access and the parallel right of economic stability. Indeed, a liberalized regime for capital movements could pose serious stability problems during times of crisis. For this reason, it is necessary that Members are able to derogate from their obligations and adopt emergency measures. Regulating the movement of capital in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) requires stretching the regulatory oversight of WTO law over different aspects of international economic policy. Indeed, capital movements are a fundamental component of the balance of payments and have a major role in shaping monetary, fiscal, and financial policies. This article will analyze how the discipline provided by the GATS on capital movements will affect not only trade in services, but also the Members’ policy space on monetary and fiscal policy. The article will conclude that while the GATS offers enough policy space for the maintenance of financial stability, it does not fully take into consideration the need of Members to control capital movements in order to conduct monetary policies.", 04 May 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 581–619, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs023
7,How to Pass a Pass-Through Test: The Case of Input Subsidies,['Sherzod Shadikhodjaev'],"The pass-through principle evolved from countervailing duty cases means that where a producer of a downstream product obtains a subsidized input from an upstream producer at arm’s length, the investigating authority cannot presume, but rather must establish whether and to what extent the benefit of the input subsidy has actually been passed through downstream. The positive pass-through determination enables the importing country to impose a countervailing duty on the downstream product found to be indirectly subsidized. In this article, we show that the legal basis for the input subsidy pass-through goes beyond the scope of Part V of the SCM Agreement. We also argue that what necessitates the pass-through test is a market price paid by the downstream producer to the upstream producer, rather than the fact of corporate non-affiliation. Furthermore, the pass-through determination for all elements of the input subsidy should, in our opinion, be made at the levels of both direct and indirect subsidization. Finally, in the light of our observations, we suggest a few amendments to a proposed Doha Round text on the subsidy pass-through.", 18 June 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 621–646, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs026
8,Dual WTO Notifications of RTAS with Non-Reciprocal Trade Liberalization,['Jong Bum Kim'],"Disagreement between the parties involved in regional trade agreements (RTAs) about the legal basis of RTAs has led to dual notifications of some RTAs to the WTO. Dually notified RTAs are characterized by non-reciprocal trade liberalization between developing and developed RTA parties. If all the parties of a dually notified RTA are ‘developing’ countries, the RTA can find its legal basis both under Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause. In that case, the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) and the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) may both serve as forums for reviewing dually notified RTAs under the Transparency Mechanism for Regional Trade Agreements. However, if one of the parties of a dually notified RTA is a ‘developed’ country, the RTA’s legal basis is solely in Article XXIV. To determine the development status of the parties to a dually notified RTA, the WTO should require the RTA party notifying under Article XXIV to disclose its economic development status for the purpose of the WTO review based on the ‘self-selection’ principle. If the party notifying under Article XXIV declares itself a ‘developed’ country, the CRTA would be the sole forum for the review. However, if the party declares itself a ‘developing’ country, both the CRTA and the CTD may serve as appropriate forums for the review. A proposal made during the Doha Round to require all RTA parties to make a joint notification under a single legal basis is inconsistent with the WTO law and would not serve the purpose of effective review of RTAs under the WTO.", 28 March 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 647–672, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs014
9,Alternative Dispute Resolution for Stakeholders in International Investment Law,['David Collins'],"This article discusses several alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms that intend to address complaints from civil society stakeholder groups that may suffer as a consequence of foreign direct investment. ADR methods such as mediation are well suited to resolving international investment disputes of this nature because these methods are more accessible to such stakeholders in the developing world where conventional fora such as civil courts may be unavailable, not independent, or else too expensive. The article explores common stakeholder grievance procedures within the international development banks that fund investment projects in the developing world. It then examines the national contact points procedures established under the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as well as a new office maintained by the Canadian government for complaints regarding foreign investment in the extractive sector. The article concludes by recommending ways in which participation in these types of processes by investors and other stakeholders can be improved through mandatory provisions in international investment agreements.", 04 April 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 673–700, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs019
