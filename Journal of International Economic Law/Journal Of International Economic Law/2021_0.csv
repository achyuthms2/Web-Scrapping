This issue also marks a transition of editors-in-chief: from Professors Chris Brummer and Joost Pauwelyn to Professors Kathleen Claussen, Sergio Puig, and Michael Waibel. We are honoured and delighted to follow in the giant footsteps of all former editors-in-chief of the Journal, including the father of international economic law, Professor John H. Jackson. We thank Chris and Joost for their invaluable advice over the last several months that ensured a smooth transition, and their exemplary leadership to which the Journal and the entire community of international economic law are much indebted. We wish them well in their exciting new professional endeavors.
Looking forward, we are committed to continuing the outstanding work of our predecessors which has made the Journal the leading publication in the field of international economic law and will count on the support and...", 10 March 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 1–3, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab009
1,Brexit and Trade Defence: Effects of a Changed Territory,['Fabian Bickel'],"After the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU), the EU’s trade defence measures no longer applied to the territory of the UK. This means that the UK now applies its own trade defence measures and has transitioned some of the EU’s trade defence measures. The EU applies its trade defence measures to the reduced territory of the EU27, while third parties that had imposed trade defence measures against the EU now apply them against the EU27 and the UK. This article analyses the compatibility of these changed measures with WTO law. It argues first that in principle WTO law allows changes in the territorial scope of trade defence measures if the investigation and imposition of the measures remain attributable to the imposing WTO Member. This defends the EU’s and the UK’s approaches. Second, changed circumstances’ reviews or adaptations of the measures by the EU or the UK may be necessary. However, this happens rarely and only if specific evidence is provided. Third, subject to review or adaptations where warranted, third countries can apply their measures targeting the EU against the EU27 and the UK.", 22 February 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 5–24, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab005
2,Retooling the Sustainability Standards in EU Free Trade Agreements,"['Marco Bronckers', ' Giovanni Gruni']","The EU’s weak promotional policy towards sustainability in its free trade arguments is up for revision. Labour and environmental standards need to be tightened. They were given a boost on balance by a remarkable panel ruling of January 2021 in the long-standing EU–Korea labour dispute. Compliance ought to be subject to regular dispute settlement between governments. Sanctions must be added to the EU’s toolbox, going beyond trade retaliation. Private stakeholders should become more involved in monitoring and enforcement, both at the international and at the domestic level. All this will put an extra responsibility on the EU and its Member States to protect their labour force and the environment as well.", 23 February 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 25–51, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab007
3,Beyond Trade War: Reevaluating Intellectual Property Bilateralism in the US–China Context,"['Carrie Shu Shang', ' Wei Shen']","The Economic and Trade Agreement between the USA and the People’s Republic of China (hereinafter the ‘Phase One Agreement’) concluded in January 2020 leaves many important questions unanswered. This article goes beyond narrow textualist approaches and seeks to conceptualize the current trade tension by providing an alternative narrative with a focus on China’s post–Trade War commitments to higher intellectual property rights standards. In particular, it focuses on the bilateral interaction between the USA and China during and shortly after the Trade War and how the interaction impacts China’s legal changes from a transnational law perspective. It further argues that US-reinforced intellectual property rights rules have potentially paved the way for further US–China trade and investment talks. However, in order to better maintain a long-term balance between preservation of policymaking autonomy and regulation of protectionist measures, an approach better aligned with the World Trade Organization framework needs to be pursued.", 20 February 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 53–76, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab003
4,Settling Interstate Trade Disputes: Lessons from the EFTA Complaints Procedure,['Johannes Hendrik Fahner'],"When the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) was founded 60 years ago, the contracting parties established a dispute settlement procedure that sought to strike a balance between the need to supervise compliance with the EFTA Convention and the need to respect the sovereignty of the member states. The procedure of Article 31 empowered the EFTA Council to hear interstate complaints, establish examining committees, issue recommendations, and authorize retaliation. This article investigates the successes and failures of this mechanism on the basis of historical documents from the EFTA archives. It provides an overview of the complaints that were brought under Article 31 and analyses how the Council exercised its functions in dealing with these cases. The article evaluates why the complaints procedure quickly fell into disuse, finding that it failed to provide a real alternative to ordinary discussions in the Council. The article argues that lessons can be drawn from this understudied chapter of European integration, concluding that systems of dispute settlement in international economic law should avoid fusing diplomatic and judicial elements if this might preclude an independent evaluation of the legal questions raised in the context of a concrete dispute.", 24 February 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 77–97, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab004
5,Feminist Overview of International Investment Law—A Preliminary Inquiry,"['Amit Kumar Sinha', ' Pushkar Anand']","There have not been many studies to evaluate the tenets of international investment law from a feminist perspective. Thus, a study from a feminist perspective is not only desirable but also necessary to understand the position of women in this regime. To fill this gap, the article presents an analysis of the normative and structural frameworks of international investment law from a feminist standpoint. This article finds that women are under-represented in the structural framework of international investment law, and the normative framework barely touches upon the issues of women. The article suggests measures to gender-mainstream the investment law regime. It concludes that gender inclusiveness of the international investment regime can only be achieved when international investment policymaking is complemented by a flexible but robust municipal structure that supports gender equality and women’s participation in economic activities.", 10 March 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 99–125, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab008
6,Do Economic Crises Trigger Treaty–Based Investor–State Arbitration Disputes?,"['Christian Bellak', ' Markus Leibrecht']","The number of investor–state arbitration disputes has increased to more than 1000 to date, but their determinants are still not fully understood. We argue that in the wake of severe macroeconomic turmoil—economic crisis—policymakers have strong incentives to implement regulatory changes, even if these allegedly breach protection standards are provided by International Investment Agreements (IIAs). We base our empirical analysis on a unique country-dyadic dataset containing 961 investor–state arbitration claims over the 1987–2017 period. Our findings support the results of the related literature, which stresses the importance of good governance for avoiding arbitration cases. In contrast to this literature, we provide robust evidence consistent with a positive statistical association of economic crises and the number of investor–state arbitration disputes. Our investigation suggests that governments risk paying compensation to foreign investors for their actions in times when public regulation is needed in other areas. This may warrant a reconsideration of economic emergency measures of governments and the national security clause in International Investment Agreements in the current reform debate.", 26 February 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 127–155, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab002
7,Environmental and Human Rights Counterclaims in International Investment Arbitration: at the Crossroads of Domestic and International Law,['Xuan Shao'],"Recently, environmental and human rights (EHR) counterclaims in investment arbitration have attracted much attention as a vehicle to recalibrate the investor–state relationship. However, until now, successful instances of EHR counterclaims have been admittedly rare. As explained in this paper, some of the major barriers to EHR counterclaims in investment arbitration, and some of the concerns associated with them, are rooted in the domestic law basis of such counterclaims. Contrary to the position of several commentators, this paper argues that the grounding of EHR counterclaims on international law is neither practical nor beneficial, and EHR counterclaims are necessarily based on domestic law. Therefore, when investment arbitral tribunals adjudicate EHR counterclaims, they essentially act as an alternative to domestic courts. This has several implications. First, on questions of jurisdiction and admissibility of EHR counterclaims, decisions of states and arbitral tribunals essentially turn on the pros and cons of having these claims adjudicated by investment arbitral tribunals as opposed to domestic courts. Second, weaknesses in domestic rules, including the difficulty of holding shareholders accountable, would carry over to EHR counterclaims. Such problems can only be efficiently tackled at the level of domestic law. Third, as revealed from the inconsistent decisions in Perenco and Burlington on the merits of the environmental counterclaims, having investment arbitral tribunals adjudicate domestic law-based EHR counterclaims may cause certain concerns. For EHR counterclaims to play a more beneficial role, decision-makers must bear in mind these factors and concerns when taking their policy choices.", 23 February 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 157–179, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab001
8,A Pareto-Improving Compensation Rule for Investment Treaties,"['Emma Aisbett', ' Jonathan Bonnitcha']","Investment treaties grant foreign investors legal rights to compensation for losses caused by certain host state conduct. Many states are reconsidering their involvement in these treaties because they perceive the risks to outweigh the benefits. We start from the normative premise that participation in investment treaties should benefit both ‘host’ and ‘home’ states. Using a law and economics approach, we model a variety of common fact scenarios that arise in investment treaty arbitration. Our modelling demonstrates that being party to an investment treaty does not necessarily benefit a host state. The objective of mutual benefits would be achieved if investment treaties were modified to provide only the minimum protection necessary to solve time inconsistency problems for the host state and, thereby, deter opportunistic conduct. The treaties should not place wider constraints on legal and policy change. Our specific proposal is that a state should only have to compensate the investor if it breaches or modifies the domestic legal regime governing the investment and that compensation should be the lesser of the investor’s loss and the host state’s gain from the host state not having had the new legal regime in place when the investment was made.", 26 February 2021,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 181–202, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgab006
9,Evolutionary Interpretation and International Law,['Geraldo Vidigal'],"Debates about the meaning of ‘evolutionary interpretation’ reveal the existence of two conflicting views. Some see evolutionary interpretation as an inevitable step in the ordinary process of applying fixed written language to changing reality. Others see it as a means for interpreters—and, crucially, adjudicators—to update the agreement being applied, infusing into the text the interpreter’s view of what would be a desirable development of the relevant provisions. Benefitting from the views expounded and decisions collected by the authors of Evolutionary Interpretation and International Law, edited by Georges Abi-Saab, Kenneth Keith, Gabrielle Marceau, and Clément Marquet (Hart 2020), this piece investigates two core questions that run through debates regarding evolutionary interpretation. First is the question of what is meant by evolutionary interpretation, whether an unavoidable step in the norm application process or a decision to develop obligations beyond their original scope. Second is the question of the distinctive role of adjudicators, i.e. of whether evolutionary interpretation is a tool used by adjudicators to exercise authority over the legal framework being applied, bypassing the constraints of the consent-based international rule-making system.", 03 December 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 203–219, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa035
10,"The Law of Political Economy: Transformation in the Function of Law; Ordo-Liberalism, Law and the Rule of Economics",['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"Book Review Essay: Varieties of Capitalism as Regulatory Challenge of International Economic Law
With the US destruction of the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2019, climate change and the economic crises and financial challenges provoked by the global COVID-19 health pandemic, international economic law (IEL) has reached a crossroads. This disruption of the post-1945, US-led multilateral order reflects increasing ideological conflicts between Anglo-Saxon neo-liberal nationalism (as illustrated by the ‘Brexit’ and President Trump’s power-oriented ‘America first’ policies), authoritarian state capitalism (as illustrated by China’s totalitarian ‘communist party state’ and Russia’s aggressive nationalism under President Putin), and Europe’s ordo-liberal constitutionalism (as illustrated by the EU’s ‘common market constitution’ and Europe’s multilevel human rights constitution). Geopolitical ‘systemic rivalries’ are not only likely to last and to require transformations and decentralization of multilateral, global treaty systems (like WTO law); this risks further undermining the multilevel governance of global...", 10 December 2020,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 221–228, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgaa043
