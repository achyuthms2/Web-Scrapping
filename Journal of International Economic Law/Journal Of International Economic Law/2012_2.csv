0,Mini-Symposium on Multilevel Governance of Interdependent Public Goods  Introduction and Overview: A Research Agenda for Making ‘Global Public Goods Theory’ More Policy Relevant,['Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann'],"This symposium summarizes the main conclusions of an interdisciplinary conference on Multilevel Governance of Interdependent Public Goods at the European University Institute, Florence, in Spring 2011 and reproduces 4 of the altogether 15 conference papers. 1 This ‘Introduction’ identifies areas where global public goods theories need further research. The ‘keynote speech’ by WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy gives a unique policy perspective on ‘Global Governance: From Theory to Practice’. Inge Kaul’s paper on ‘Global Public Goods Theory: Explaining the Underprovision of International Public Goods and Corrective Strategies’ offers a summary—by one of the leading researchers on public goods theory—of the main ‘collective action problems’ impeding multilevel governance of interdependent public goods. ‘The G-20 and Global Economic Governance: Lessons from Multilevel European Governance?’, by Jan Wouters and Thomas Ramopoulos, discusses the policy question of whether reforms of the G-20 meetings can and should be inspired by European experiences of multilevel governance. Daniel Esty and Anthony Moffa explore ‘Why Climate Change Collective Action has Failed and What Needs to be Done Within and Without the Trade Regime’. One major conclusion of the symposium is that economic and political ‘public goods theories’ neglect law and constitutionalism as instruments for producing ‘aggregate public goods’. Remedying this neglect requires integrating legal and constitutional theories into public goods research. Reconciling, on the one hand, the power-oriented ‘ethos of diplomats’ focus on promotion of ‘national interests’ through ‘rule by law’ with, on the other hand, the justice-oriented ‘ethos of constitutional democracies’ focus on cosmopolitan rights protecting individual and democratic self-development through ‘rule of law’ remains the biggest challenge in protecting international ‘aggregate public goods’ in the 21st century.", 14 September 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 3, September 2012, Pages 709–719, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs031
1,Scoping the Boundary Between the Trade Law and Investment Law Regimes: When Does A Measure Relate to Investment?,['Arwel Davies'],"The interaction between trade and investment dispute settlement proceedings has been described by investment tribunals and academic commentators as complex, and as at an infant stage. This article considers an aspect of this interaction; specifically the matter of how we should think about measures which are plainly capable of challenge in the trade regime and which also affect the economic interests of investors and their investments. The question is whether there is a compelling need to shift the review of such measures towards the trade regime, or whether such measures can be thought of as simply capable of challenge in both regimes. This article defends the second perspective.", 24 July 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 3, September 2012, Pages 793–822, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs027
2,Reassessing the Prospects of a Human Rights Safeguard Policy at the World Bank,['Suzanne Zhou'],"Despite 20 years of attempts to introduce human rights concerns into formal World Bank policy, and increasing recognition of the importance that human rights play in the its work, the World Bank has yet to adopt a comprehensive safeguard policy dealing with the relationship between its activities and international human rights law obligations. Two reasons have been given for this reluctance: the legal prohibition on political interference in the World Bank’s Articles of Agreement, and concerns about how effective or appropriate a safeguard policy relating to human rights would be in practice. In this article, I review the legal and institutional obstacles to the adoption of a human rights safeguard policy, and suggest that they can be overcome by using a dialogue-based form of safeguard policy that incorporates human rights obligations incumbent upon the Bank and borrower countries into the benchmarks for the development success of the project.", 24 July 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 3, September 2012, Pages 823–841, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs029
3,Government Control of Cross-Border M&A: Legitimate Regulation or Protectionism?,['Andreas Heinemann'],"Recently, much light has been shed on the conditions under which Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows are beneficial to the receiving state and its citizens. However, when inbound FDI takes the form of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As, as opposed to ‘greenfield investment’), nations often see their interests affected. Whereas favouring domestic over foreign ownership is restricted to the field of national security in some countries, other governments seem to perceive a general threat with any takeover from abroad. Accordingly, an increasing number of states have installed control mechanisms that attempt to screen cross-border takeovers for their compatibility with national interests. This article consists of both a legal and an economic analysis. First, an inventory is made of national policy instruments that provide a nation with control over the takeover of domestic firms by foreign investors. Second, we examine the extent to which national control instruments are compatible with international economic law, including regional integration agreements. Third, we discuss the economic reasons for cross-border M&A and the reasons for government control of these transactions. Consisting of both normative and positive elements, the analysis is not restricted to questioning whether and why governments should provide for state control of cross-border takeovers; rather, it extends to the actual motivation behind state interference. The article concludes with several policy proposals.", 26 July 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 3, September 2012, Pages 843–870, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs030
4,Awakening the Sleeping Giant: Intellectual Property Rights in International Investment Agreements,['Bryan Mercurio'],"This article explores the complex issues relating to the inclusion of intellectual property rights (IPRs) as an ‘investment’ in international investment agreements (IIAs). The potential impact of IPRs in IIAs on the regulatory sovereignty of a nation has for some time been underappreciated and undervalued in both practice and the academic literature. The issue became topical, and controversial, when cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris relied on IIAs to challenge IP-related tobacco regulations in Uruguay and Australia, but there persists a general lack of understanding of how IPRs are included in IIAs and the extent to which an IPR owner can rely on an IIA to enforce its rights. This article seeks to fill the gap by adding to existing knowledge of the inclusion and significance of IPRs in IIAs. More specifically, the article first reviews how IPRs qualify as a covered ‘investment’ in IIAs before introducing and analysing the relevance of some of the more significant clauses frequently appearing in IIAs. While extensive illustrative reference is made to the claims against both Uruguay and Australia the article does not purport to fully analyse either of those two ongoing disputes.", 14 September 2012,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 15, Issue 3, September 2012, Pages 871–915, https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs032
