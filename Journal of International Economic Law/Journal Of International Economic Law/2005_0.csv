0,The WTO Dispute Settlement System: The First Ten Years,['William J. Davey'],"This paper reviews the operation of the WTO’s dispute settlement system during its first ten years – from 1995 to 2004. After a brief overview of the system, the experience of several major users of the system – the United States, the European Communities, Canada, Japan, Brazil and India – is examined and an evaluation is made in terms of how they have fared in advancing their major trade policy concerns on a subject matter and a country-by-country basis. Particular attention is paid to certain bilateral relationships, such as that of the United States and the EC. The paper then evaluates the system’s success in settling disputes, in terms of whether disputes have been settled promptly, either through mutually agreed solutions or through implementation of panel/Appellate Body reports. The paper concludes that since its inception in 1995, the system has worked reasonably well in providing a reasonably effective mechanism through which WTO Members are able to resolve disputes, both at the consultation stage and following completion of formal dispute settlement proceedings. The system has not, however, achieved its goal of promptness in many cases.", 01 January 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 1, MARCH 2005, Pages 17–50, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi003
1,"Decision-Making in the World Trade Organization: Is the Consensus Practice of the World Trade Organization Adequate for Making, Revising and Implementing Rules on International Trade?","['Claus-Dieter Ehlermann', ' Lothar Ehring']","Globalization creates a demand for international rule-making, and the WTO remains the forum for creating binding and enforceable international trade rules. The WTO therefore needs an effective decision-making system capable of resolving diverging interests. Although the WTO Agreement foresees votes where consensus cannot be reached, the practice of consensus dominates the process of decision-making. The GATT 1947 only spoke of voting and did not mention the word ‘consensus’. The WTO Agreement reflects the evolution from votes to consensus in the GATT 1947. Nevertheless, voting was not abandoned in the WTO Agreement. Although the consensus practice generally works well, it nevertheless implies the risk of deadlock and in particular the Membership’s inability to respond legislatively where it disagrees with a panel’s or the Appellate Body’s legal interpretation. Consensus also inherently favours the status quo and can make it extremely difficult to achieve change. Consensus does not provide for equality (in terms of decision and influence) because not every Member has the same ability to maintain vetoes. Consensus of course has many advantages, but it is questionable whether it is also more democratic than the majority rule.", 01 January 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 1, MARCH 2005, Pages 51–75, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi004
2,Toward a New Era of Objective Assessment in the Field of TRIPS and Variable Geometry for the Preservation of Multilateralism,['Fredrick M. Abbott'],"The TRIPS Agreement emerged from the Uruguay Round negotiations as one of the three pillars of the WTO. This article offers a preliminary assessment of the first ten years under the TRIPS Agreement. Based on that assessment, it makes suggestions for the future.
The objective of the principal developed country demandeurs of the TRIPS Agreement was to increase information and technology rent payments from developing countries. Incomplete implementation and enforcement was anticipated. Taking this into account, the Agreement has resulted in a substantial transformation of legal infrastructure in developing countries and has increased rent payment outflows to the owners of intellectual property (IP) rights. From this standpoint, the TRIPS Agreement has been successful in accomplishing its objectives.
From the standpoint of developing countries, it is more difficult to identify positive effects. China is the major developing country success story of the past decade, and it has achieved its historic accomplishments in the face of intensive criticism of its IP regime. The TRIPS Agreement has come under harsh public scrutiny for the role attributed to it by the pharmaceutical industry in South Africa, ultimately leading to the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. As a consequence of a somewhat more balanced approach to TRIPS now achieved at the WTO, the United States in particular has shifted to bilateral and regional fora to obtain higher standards of protection and enforcement, calling into question the relevance of TRIPS Council deliberations.
This article makes several recommendations. First, that new agreements concerning IP rights be subject to objective prior impact assessment. Second, that WTO Members give greater recognition to the fact that IP rules have significantly different public welfare implications depending on their field of application and the level of development of the implementing country. As the TRIPS Agreement transition periods have largely expired, the manner by which the TRIPS Council assesses its rules and makes provision for TRIPS-plus and TRIPS-minus adjustments might be restructured along industrial subject matter and developmental lines, taking better account of the impact-in-fact of IP rules on societies.
In June 2004 a group of trade specialists was brought together at the World Trade Forum in Berne in a ‘preliminary stocktaking’ exercise to assess the first ten years of the World Trade Organization.1 This article was prepared for that occasion and addresses the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the ‘TRIPS Agreement’) on its ten-year anniversary.", 01 January 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 1, MARCH 2005, Pages 77–100, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi005
3,Financial Compensation in the WTO: Improving the Remedies of WTO Dispute Settlement,"['Marco Bronckers', ' Naboth van den Broek']","The current system of remedies in the WTO provides Members with a choice between trade compensation or retaliation. There is a problem in that trade compensation is only possible with the consent of the non-complying country and thus often remains theoretical, while retaliation has the disadvantage of requiring the complaining Member to ‘shoot itself in the foot’ by restricting imports and thus hurting its own industrial users, importers and consumers. Such retaliatory restrictions also hurt innocent bystanders abroad: private parties who are not involved in a dispute lose their export markets. As importantly, the current system does not provide for effective reparation of damages suffered by the WTO Member and private parties concerned. These problems are even more urgent for developing countries. Many of them cannot effectively retaliate: their economies are too small to make an impression on the infringing country, and the negative effects of such countermeasures would be felt disproportionately by their own economies and businesses. Introducing financial compensation could be a solution. Financial compensation does not restrict trade, helps to compensate injured Members and industries, avoids hurting innocent bystanders, and can contribute to more effective compliance. In addition to analysing the problems with current remedies and the pros and cons of financial compensation, this article outlines what financial compensation in the WTO could look like.", 01 January 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 1, MARCH 2005, Pages 101–126, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi006
4,Practical Aspects of Monetary Compensation: The US – Copyright Case,"['Bernard O’Connor', ' Margareta Djordjevic']","The mutually satisfactory temporary arrangement reached between the EC and the US in the WTO US – Copyright dispute raises a number of legal issues in international, WTO and EC law as well as systemic considerations for the WTO dispute settlement system. It is the first time that monetary compensation has been granted within the terms of Article 22 of the DSU. The agreement is that the US makes a payment of moneys directly to a specific private body in the EC as a temporary arrangement during a period of implementation. The availability and mechanics of monetary compensation as a WTO remedy is currently being debated (see, among many others, ‘Financial Compensation in the WTO: Improving the Remedies of WTO Dispute Settlement’ in this journal). This brief note examines whether the granting of monetary compensation in this case is consistent with the WTO agreements and, in particular, the most-favoured-nation principle. It also considers whether any inconsistency with the WTO agreements can be justified under WTO rules or general international law. Furthermore, the note outlines the international law and EC law implications of the Community’s authorization of a payment to a private party. The conclusion reached is that, while the idea of monetary compensation for private parties may have much support, considerable thought will have to be given to its practical and legal implementation both in WTO and EC law.", 01 January 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 1, MARCH 2005, Pages 127–142, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi007
5,"Climate Change, Regulatory Policy and the WTO: How Constraining Are Trade Rules?",['Andrew Green'],"Climate change has come to be seen as a major global environmental challenge. This paper examines the extent to which WTO rules constrain countries’ ability to address climate change through domestic regulatory policies such as standards, labels, voluntary agreements and domestic emissions trading programs. In particular, it examines three broad types of constraints. First, it discusses the extent to which domestic regulatory mea-sures may conflict with national treatment provisions of GATT and the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement. Second, it discusses procedural con-straints on domestic regulatory action, including from requirements related to scientific evidence. Finally, it discusses the ‘necessity’ or least restrictive means tests under GATT and the TBT Agreement. The paper argues that existing WTO rules provide members with some scope to take action on climate change. However, they do constrain domestic regulatory policy, and the debate about future institutional changes will be central to how effectively global environmental issues such as climate change will be addressed.", 01 January 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 1, MARCH 2005, Pages 143–189, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi008
6,The United Nations Convention Against Corruption: Global Achievement or Missed Opportunity?,['Philippa Webb'],"The United Nations Convention Against Corruption represents the first binding global agreement on corruption. It has elevated anticorruption action to the international stage. This article sets the context for the Convention by considering the first wave of anticorruption initiatives that occurred at the regional level. It then assesses the significance of this new international convention by examining the negotiating process and the strategic positions of different countries. In particular, it analyzes the four areas that generated the most controversy during the negotiations: asset recovery, private sector corruption, political corruption, and monitoring. Although the Convention contains many innovative provisions, the article suggests that it also suffers from some basic weaknesses that may prevent it from having a real impact on corrupt behavior.", 01 January 2005,Journal of International Economic Law, Volume 8, Issue 1, MARCH 2005, Pages 191–229, https://doi.org/10.1093/jielaw/jgi009
